description: Unified CloudBase execution guide for all-in-one skill installs. Use this first for CloudBase app tasks, especially existing apps with TODOs, fixed pages, or active handlers. Routes PostgreSQL / CloudBase PG / app.rdb() / queryPgDatabase / managePgDatabase work away from legacy NoSQL and old auth patterns.

# CloudBase All-In-One

## Workflow

Every CloudBase task follows this three-stage process:

```
1. Exploration  →  Read the matching skill completely before writing any code.
                   Search for it if needed, then Read the full SKILL.md content.
                   Only start implementing after understanding the API patterns,
                   pitfalls, and correct usage from the skill document.
2. Implementation
   ├── 2a. Resource preparation → Use MCP tools to prepare backend resources
   │     (enable auth providers, create database tables, configure storage domains,
   │      set up security rules — before writing frontend code)
   └── 2b. Frontend implementation → Write code, install deps, start server, test
3. Close-out  →  Run cloudbase-code-review, fix all errors, declare done
```

**Key constraints:**
- **Stage 2a (resource preparation) must come before frontend code.** Always use MCP tools to prepare backend resources first. Don't write frontend code that depends on uncreated resources (tables, auth providers, storage buckets) — the grader will fail.
- **Do not skip Stage 3.** The close-out catches known pitfalls that agents commonly miss during implementation.

## Scope

Only handle tasks that are part of building, integrating, or maintaining a CloudBase application — including UI design, spec planning, and other development activities when they are in service of a CloudBase app. If the request has no CloudBase application context at all, stop and tell the user this skill only covers CloudBase-based development.

## Activation Contract

### Use this first when

- The task is a CloudBase app build, integration, or repair and the workspace already contains an application implementation.
- The request mixes auth, database, storage, and frontend work in one CloudBase application task.

### Do this before broad exploration

- **Read the relevant skill before writing any code.** Search for the matching skill with `searchKnowledgeBase(mode="skill", skillName=...)`, then `Read` the returned file path to get the full SKILL.md content. Do not start implementing based only on the search result summary — the full document contains API signatures, parameter schemas, and pitfall warnings.
- Inspect the existing implementation surfaces first:
  - `src/lib/backend.*`
  - `src/lib/auth.*`
  - `src/lib/*service.*`
  - route guards
  - the page handlers bound to the active form submit buttons
- If these files contain TODOs, implement those TODOs in place before creating new helpers, examples, or replacement pages.
- Do not start with UI redesign or design-spec output unless the user explicitly asks for visual changes.
- Do not start with project-management loops such as repeated `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` when the task is a single targeted repair. Read the active files and edit them directly.

### Route quickly to the minimum needed skills

- Web app execution -> `./web-development/SKILL.md`
- Web auth provider readiness -> `./auth-tool/SKILL.md`
- Web auth implementation -> `./auth-web/SKILL.md`
- CloudBase PostgreSQL / PG app data -> `./postgresql-development/SKILL.md`
- WeChat Pay / Official Account OAuth through CloudBase Integration Center -> `./cloudbase-wechat-integration/SKILL.md`
- Browser-side document database CRUD -> `./no-sql-web-sdk/SKILL.md`
- Browser-side file upload -> `./cloud-storage-web/SKILL.md`
- Platform overview only when capability selection is still unclear -> `./cloudbase-platform/SKILL.md`
- If using `searchKnowledgeBase(mode="skill")`, pass the reference directory id such as `postgresql-development`, not the frontmatter `name` value such as `postgresql-development-cloudbase`.

### High-yield guardrails

- **Prepare backend resources via MCP before writing frontend code.** Auth providers, database tables, storage domains, and security rules must be set up through MCP tools before writing any frontend code that depends on them. Frontend code written against non-existent resources will cause grader failures.
- **Change Safety Protocol**: Before any non-trivial code or configuration change, you must strictly follow `cloudbase-platform/references/protocols/change-safety-protocol.md` (declare impact → obtain user confirmation → verify after change → escalate to root cause analysis after 3 occurrences of the same symptom).
- **Deployment Gate**: Before any deployment, publish, custom domain, CloudRun, or public exposure work, you must complete the checks in `cloudbase-platform/references/protocols/deployment-gate.md` and present the mandatory declaration template.
- If the same path fails 2-3 times, stop retrying and reroute. Check platform skill, auth domain, runtime, and permission model before editing more code.
- Always specify `EnvId` explicitly in code, configuration, and command examples when initializing CloudBase clients or manager operations. Do not rely on the current CLI-selected environment or implicit defaults.
- If the conversation only provides an environment alias, nickname, or other shorthand, resolve it with `envQuery(action=list, alias=..., aliasExact=true)` and use the returned canonical full `EnvId` before calling `auth.set_env`, generating console links, or writing config/code. If the alias is ambiguous or missing, stop and ask the user to confirm.

### Do NOT use this as

- A reason to read every CloudBase skill before touching code.
- A reason to start from platform overview when the existing code already reveals the stack and the missing pieces.

## Working rules

1. **BaaS-first, functions as last resort**:
   - Before writing any cloud function or CloudRun service, ask: can the correct JS SDK surface handle this directly? Use `db.collection(...).get()` only for confirmed NoSQL collections; use `app.rdb().from(...)` for CloudBase PG tables; use `auth` / `storage` from the matching skill.
   - Use the matching JS SDK surface directly for: data reads/writes, file uploads, real-time updates, simple queries including leaderboards, lists, aggregations.
   - Only drop down to cloud functions when: the logic requires server-side permission enforcement that cannot be expressed in database rules/RLS, calling third-party services (payment, SMS, external APIs), or background jobs not triggered by the user.
   - Only drop down to CloudRun when: persistent connections (WebSocket), long-running compute, or custom runtimes are genuinely required.

2. Existing application with TODOs:
   - Treat it as a targeted repair task, not a greenfield build.
   - Prefer the shortest path from current code to working flow.

2. Auth tasks:
   - If the account identifier is a plain username such as `admin`, `editor`, or another string without `@`, treat `usernamePassword` login as a blocking prerequisite.
   - First call `queryAppAuth(action=\"getLoginConfig\")`.
   - If `loginMethods.usernamePassword !== true`, immediately call `manageAppAuth(action=\"patchLoginStrategy\", patch={ usernamePassword: true })`.
   - In Web login code, use `auth.signInWithPassword({ username, password })`.
   - Do not assume direct Web `auth.signUp({ username, password })` is available for every environment or SDK version; verify `sdkHints` / installed SDK behavior first. If username registration is required and direct signup is unsupported, route registration through a backend or management API path that creates CloudBase Auth users, without exposing secret keys in browser code.
   - Never use `signUpWithEmailAndPassword` or `signInWithEmailAndPassword` for these username-style account flows.
   - Once readiness is confirmed, return to the active frontend handler and finish the real login/register flow.

3. Database and storage tasks:
   - Reuse the current shared `app`, `auth`, `db`, and storage helpers instead of creating parallel SDK wrappers.
   - If the task mentions CloudBase PG, PostgreSQL, Postgres, PG mode, JS SDK v3 PostgreSQL, `app.rdb()`, `queryPgDatabase`, `managePgDatabase`, `mysqldb` OpenAPI, or RLS, read `./postgresql-development/SKILL.md` before touching database code.
   - For CloudBase PG, use `queryPgDatabase` / `managePgDatabase` for schema and management; do not route PG work to MySQL `queryMysqlDatabase` / `manageMysqlDatabase` or NoSQL collection APIs.
   - For OpenAPI lookup, call `searchKnowledgeBase({ mode: "openapi", apiName: "mysqldb" })` directly. Do not pass guessed `action` values such as `getApiDocs` or `listEndpoints`; those belong to no supported tool mode.
   - For CloudBase PG Web CRUD, prefer JS SDK v3 `app.rdb()` and documented storage `app.storage.from()` APIs before raw HTTP.
   - For browser-side CloudBase storage upload from local Vite/preview, check the actual browser `host:port` in security domains first (`envQuery(action="domains")`, then `envDomainManagement(action="create")` if missing). A failed cover upload must not silently skip the subsequent PG article insert.
- For CloudBase Web SDK `db.collection(...).add(...)`, persist the created document ID from `result._id`.
- For writes, validate the actual SDK result instead of assuming success.
- **Legacy API STOP card:** If the task says `PostgreSQL`, `CloudBase PG`, `PG mode`, `app.rdb()`, `queryPgDatabase`, `managePgDatabase`, `PostgREST`, or `RLS`, do not write NoSQL examples from memory. Use `app.rdb().from(...)` for Web CRUD, `queryPgDatabase` / `managePgDatabase` for management, and `auth.getSession()` for Web auth guards. Do not use `app.database()`, `db.collection(...)`, `.where()`, `.orderBy()`, `app.uploadFile()`, `getLoginState()`, or `auth.getUser()` as the PG/auth default.

4. Targeted repair tasks:
   - Functional closure beats exploration.
   - Avoid broad repo sweeps, UI redesign, and detached demo code.
   - Keep file discovery narrow. Prefer direct reads of the known active files over `Glob` / broad search across the whole project.
