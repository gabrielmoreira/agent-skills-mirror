# Dependency-Ready Decision Frontier

Load this reference only when terminology correction exposes unresolved product or workflow decisions. A safe lookup does not enter this interview.

## Entry

Ask for explicit confirmation before starting. First inspect repository and source evidence for facts Hermes can discover. The user owns product decisions; do not ask them to retrieve facts available locally.

## Dependency Model

Represent each unresolved decision with its prerequisites and dependents. In each round, present the whole dependency-ready frontier: every unresolved decision whose prerequisites are already settled. Do not ask a question in the same round when its wording or options depend on another answer from that round.

For each frontier item:

1. state the decision and why it changes shared understanding;
2. summarize observed evidence and unknowns;
3. give one concise recommendation with the main tradeoff;
4. ask for the user's decision, correction, or skip.

Record agreed canonical identity and short definition separately from design rationale. Keep rare, hard-to-reverse tradeoffs as decision notes rather than glossary entries.

## Stop and Transition

Continue until every reachable branch is resolved, explicitly deferred, or blocked by named missing evidence. Read back the shared understanding and ask the user to confirm it. Confirmation closes the interview; it does not approve implementation.

After confirmation, offer either `ulw-plan` for a reviewed implementation plan or a selected executor-neutral coding-owner handoff when work is already plan-ready. Ask for a separate go-ahead before preparing either. A prepared handoff is not dispatch, execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, merge, or proof that the recipient used the terminology.
