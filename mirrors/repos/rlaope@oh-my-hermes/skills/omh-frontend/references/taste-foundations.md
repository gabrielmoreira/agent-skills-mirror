# Taste Foundations

**Hold the work to what a senior product designer at a top-tier product company — the Linear/Stripe/Supabase class — would sign off on. Technically clean output that reads
flat does not clear this bar — flatness is a defect to fix, not a baseline
to accept.** Generic output is not a neutral outcome; it is the specific
failure this reference exists to prevent.

## Name one primary direction

Taste directions pull in different directions; blending them by accident
produces mud. Name ONE primary direction in `DESIGN.md` section 1. An
element genuinely borrowed from another direction is allowed — named there
with its reason — so a hybrid brief (a premium marketing shell over an
operational product) stays expressible without dissolving into no direction
at all.

- **Operational** — dense internal tools and dashboards where utility
  leads: information density over drama, native controls, stable
  dimensions, restrained color. Typical failure: settling here when the
  brief wants a public, polished surface.
- **Minimalist / editorial** — briefs that want whitespace-led calm and
  reading-first structure: generous space, a strict type scale doing the
  hierarchy work, a single accent, almost no ornament. Typical failure:
  emptiness without rhythm — minimal is a spacing system, not an absence.
- **Premium / soft** — surfaces that should feel costly and unhurried:
  layered depth, soft large-radius shadows, muted-but-saturated palette,
  slow small motion. Typical failure: gloss layered over weak hierarchy.
- **Bold / expressive** — statement pages that lead with oversized display
  type and hard contrast, breaking one grid rule at a time on purpose.
  Typical failure: every element shouting, so nothing leads.

## Anti-slop checklist — reject on sight

- Template gravity: rows of three equal cards, hero-icon-grid boilerplate,
  floating decorative shapes with no content role.
- One-note palette: a single flood color plus gray, no layered backgrounds,
  no semantic states.
- Weak hierarchy: adjacent text sizes doing three jobs, everything at
  medium weight, headings that do not organize scanning.
- Arrhythmic spacing: values off the scale, sections that touch, sibling
  padding that differs for no stated reason.
- Placeholder gravity: lorem-shaped copy, unrealistic content, empty states
  never designed.
- Missing states: any interactive primitive without hover, focus-visible,
  active, disabled, loading, error, and empty treatments.
- Motion as decoration: animation that communicates neither state nor
  causality, or that ignores `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- CJK as an afterthought: Latin-tuned line-height and truncation applied
  unchanged to a Korean, Japanese, or Chinese audience.

## Content before chrome

Before laying anything out, list what the surface must say and decide what
each block is for: draw attention, explain, build trust, support
comparison, drive the action, or help people find their way. Sequence
sections in the order a visitor actually decides; visual symmetry never
outranks that sequence. Review content accuracy and hierarchy before any
polish — a beautiful wrong page fails first on content.

## Boundary

Taste guidance shapes the prepared direction and contract. It never
substitutes for observed rendered evidence: the visual-QA owner judges what
actually shipped.

## Attribution

The idea of pairing a design-system contract file with taste-direction
material and an evidence-bound critique lane adapts concepts from the
`frontend` skill of `code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent@9c62b62` (Sustainable Use
License 1.0) and its permissively licensed design upstreams:
`Leonxlnx/taste-skill` (MIT), `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill` (MIT),
`Owl-Listener/designpowers` (MIT), and `nexu-io/open-design` (Apache-2.0).
No upstream text is reproduced; the wording here is OMH's own, and OMH keeps
its deterministic no-render boundary. Product names appear as quality
analogies only; OMH is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any
named company.
