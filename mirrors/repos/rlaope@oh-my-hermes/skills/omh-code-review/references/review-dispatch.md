# Requesting a Review

`code-review` states what a review must contain. This states how to obtain one.
Load it when dispatching a reviewer, not when reading a finding.

## Name the range before dispatching

A reviewer handed the wrong range reviews a fraction of the change and returns
a clean verdict on code nobody read. That is a manufactured pass, and it is the
exact failure the evidence boundary exists to prevent.

```sh
BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)   # or the commit recorded before the work began
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**Never `HEAD~1`.** It silently drops every commit of a multi-commit task except
the last. Record BASE before the work starts; deriving it afterwards from the
log is guesswork the moment a merge or a fixup lands.

State both SHAs in the request. A review whose range is unstated cannot be
re-run, and cannot be shown to have covered anything.

## Hand over artifacts, not bodies

Everything pasted into a dispatch stays resident for the rest of the session and
is re-read on every later turn. Write the diff, the plan section, and the failing
output to files under `.omh/artifacts/` or `.omh/handoffs/` and pass the paths.

A dispatch describes one unit of work. Do not paste accumulated prior-task
summaries into later dispatches - a fresh reviewer needs the range, the
requirements, and the constraints, and nothing else.

## What the request must carry

- **Range** - BASE_SHA and HEAD_SHA, both spelled out.
- **Claim** - what the author says this does. The review is against this claim.
- **Requirements** - a path to the plan or spec section, not its pasted text.
- **Constraints** - anything project-wide the diff must satisfy.
- **Return contract** - findings first, severity per finding, and the file, line,
  and command output each one rests on.

## Reading the report

A reviewer's report is a claim, not evidence. Two rules keep it honest:

- **Do not trust the report.** A stated rationale never downgrades a finding's
  severity. "I checked and it is fine" is not a check; the command output is.
- **"Attempted" is not "addressed."** A fix is done when the specific defect no
  longer reproduces, shown by the same command that showed it. A commit message
  saying it was fixed is not that command.

## The four statuses an implementer may return

Anything dispatched to change code returns exactly one of these, so the
coordinator can act without re-reading the work:

| Status | Meaning | What the coordinator does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DONE` | Complete and verified | Generate the review range, dispatch the reviewer |
| `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` | Complete, with doubts stated | Read the concerns first; address correctness or scope before review |
| `NEEDS_CONTEXT` | Missing information it could not derive | Supply exactly what is missing, re-dispatch |
| `BLOCKED` | Cannot complete | Change something - more context, a stronger model, a smaller task, or escalate |

Never re-dispatch a `BLOCKED` unit unchanged. If it said it was stuck, repeating
the request repeats the outcome.

## Boundary

A prepared review request is not a review. A returned report is not a fix, and a
fix is not verification. Each step is observed only from its own fresh output.
