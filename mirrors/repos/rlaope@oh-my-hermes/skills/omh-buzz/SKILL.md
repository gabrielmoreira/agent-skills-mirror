# Buzz

This is a Hermes-native `buzz` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

Hermes already owns the Buzz transport, but users need one discoverable OMH entry point that safely selects setup, attachment, or self-host operations and reports only the evidence actually observed.

## Do Not Use When

- The user wants a Buzz-managed ACP runtime rather than Hermes' native Buzz gateway.
- The request is general media editing with no Buzz delivery target.
- The request is generic Docker or Nostr advice unrelated to a Buzz relay.
- The user is only asking whether OMH supports Buzz, with no request to run the workflow.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Connect this Hermes gateway to my Buzz community and verify one inbound and outbound message.
- Expected behavior: Load the setup reference, collect the relay and membership inputs without exposing the private key, use Hermes' guided gateway setup, then report each observed verification stage.
- Why: The request names the native gateway task and an observable end-to-end stop condition.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Write a generic Nostr relay from scratch for OMH.
- Expected behavior: Route to planning or coding rather than presenting that transport as part of omh-buzz.
- Why: OMH reuses Hermes' native Buzz adapter and does not own a second Nostr transport.

## Completion Checklist

- Exactly one of setup, media, or self-host is selected from request meaning; no internal lane is public.
- Secrets remain out of argv, logs, rendered output, and workflow artifacts.
- Configuration, process, relay, event acceptance, subscription, and client rendering are separate claims.
- Any state-changing self-host command remains user-driven and has an explicit rollback or backup boundary.
- The final answer names what was observed, what remains unobserved, and the next smallest proof action.

## Recovery Notes

- If the Buzz CLI is missing, stop at installation guidance and do not claim gateway readiness.
- If relay authentication fails, separate membership, identity, and NIP-42 evidence before changing config.
- If a send receipt is malformed or lacks an event id, report ambiguous delivery and do not auto-retry.
- If self-host readiness is green but media fails, inspect MinIO and disk separately from relay readiness.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `buzz`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `+34 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Choose One Internal Lane

`omh-buzz` is the only public skill. Choose exactly one reference from the
request's meaning after this skill is selected:

- Load `references/setup.md` to connect or repair Hermes' native Buzz gateway.
- Load `references/media.md` to deliver a local attachment to the active Buzz
  conversation and report staged delivery evidence.
- Load `references/self-host.md` to inspect or guide a self-hosted Buzz relay.

Do not expose these references as separate skills and do not select them with
a hard-coded keyword branch. If the request genuinely spans lanes, start with
setup/readiness, then load only the next reference required by observed state.

## Ownership Boundary

Hermes owns the native Buzz transport, authentication, inbound subscriptions,
and outbound CLI invocation. OMH owns this operator workflow, the `buzz`
platform identity layered over source `hermes`, safe evidence boundaries, and
progressive guidance. Block's Buzz relay and CLI own their runtime semantics.

## Use When

Use when the user wants to configure or troubleshoot Hermes' native Buzz gateway, attach local media to the active Buzz conversation, or inspect a self-hosted Buzz relay. Select the setup, media, or self-host reference from the request's meaning after this single public skill is selected.

    Strong routing signals: `connect Hermes to Buzz`, `Buzz community agent`, `Buzz gateway setup`, `Buzz media attachment`, `Buzz relay self-hosting`, `Buzz connection diagnostics`, `버즈 커뮤니티 연결`, `Buzz 메시지 첨부`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operator`
Phase: `messaging-integration`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `evidence-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
- Separate Hermes guidance from executor or wrapper behavior unless evidence proves the step happened.

Handoff policy:

Operate through Hermes' native Buzz adapter and official Buzz surfaces. Keep state-changing self-host commands user-driven and delegate repository code changes only when the user explicitly asks for them.

Required inputs:

- Buzz task: gateway setup, media delivery, or self-host diagnosis
- target Hermes home or active Buzz conversation
- observable stop condition

Expected outputs:

- selected Buzz workflow lane
- bounded setup or diagnostic evidence
- observed delivery stage or explicit unobserved boundary

Artifact expectations:

- redacted Buzz readiness summary when setup is inspected
- delivery receipt with accepted event id when media is sent
- self-host failure-tree evidence when relay health is diagnosed

Safety rules:

- Reuse Hermes' native Buzz transport; do not implement or imply an OMH-owned Nostr transport.
- Never print, persist in workflow artifacts, or place the Buzz private key in argv or shell history.
- Do not treat CLI presence, configuration presence, or a prepared command as live relay readiness.
- Do not claim message delivery without accepted=true and a non-empty event id from the send receipt.
- Guide, don't drive state-changing self-host operations unless the user explicitly approves each action.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `coding-handling`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill buzz --harness coding-handling --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
