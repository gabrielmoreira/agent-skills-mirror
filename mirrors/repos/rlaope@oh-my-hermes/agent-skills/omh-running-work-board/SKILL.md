# Running Work Board

This is an OMH `running-work-board` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`running-work-board` exists because multi-session coding work was invisible: the runtime was tracked but the model was dropped, token counts had no write site at all, and a blocking dispatch could not report that it was still running. The board answers which model on which runtime, or says unknown.

## Do Not Use When

- The user wants to start, plan, or dispatch coding work rather than observe it.
- The user wants review, CI, or merge evidence, which a status board never provides.
- The user is asking about their own application's runtime status rather than OMH coding units.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: what is running right now
- Expected behavior: One line per unit: label, runtime, model, status, elapsed, tokens, with unknown printed where nothing was observed.
- Why: The request is about observed local coding activity, not about starting work.

Bad example:

- Prompt: is the deploy done and did CI pass
- Expected behavior: Route to verification or CI evidence instead of the activity board.
- Why: Observed activity is not result, review, CI, or merge evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Runtime and model are named per unit, or explicitly reported as unknown.
- Token counts and session references are observed values or the literal unknown, never estimates.
- Elapsed time for an unfinished unit comes from its start marker, which cannot prove the unit is still alive.
- The board is labelled observed activity, not result, verification, review, CI, or merge evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If no units are found, say so plainly rather than implying nothing ever ran.
- If a marker is stale because a process died, report it as observed-start-without-end instead of claiming the unit is running.
- If tokens are unknown for a runtime with no structured output, say the runtime does not report them.



## Use When

Use when the user asks what coding work is running right now -- which unit, which runtime, which model, how long, how many tokens -- rather than asking to start, plan, or review work.

    Strong routing signals: `running-work-board`, `running work board`, `which units are running`, `what models are running`, `지금 뭐 돌고 있어`, `뭐가 돌고 있어`, `어떤 모델로 돌고 있어`, `실행 중인 작업 보여줘`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operator`
Phase: `observability`
Quality tier: `evidence-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
- Separate Hermes guidance from executor or wrapper behavior unless evidence proves the step happened.

Required inputs:

- local coding artifacts

Expected outputs:

- per-unit runtime and model
- observed tokens and elapsed
- explicit unknowns

Artifact expectations:

- metadata-only status board projection from local artifacts

Safety rules:

- Do not imply hidden Hermes runtime behavior.
- Use the smallest verification that can prove the claim.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Record actual tool results, or
`not_observed` / `not_available`, in the record; never invent dispatch or host
accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: OMH's record terms
(surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in
records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask
about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn,
offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
