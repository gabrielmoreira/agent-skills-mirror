# Idea To Deploy

This is an OMH `idea-to-deploy` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`idea-to-deploy` exists to keep `delivery` work explicit, evidence-backed, and inside the Hermes/executor boundary instead of relying on ad hoc chat narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is already a concrete repo change whose stopping point is one PR-ready cycle, not product or release operations; use `ultrawork`.
- The request is a settings-only change, one bounded edit that is explicitly low-risk and has a direct owner and verification path, or a direct answer/diagnosis; handle it directly instead of opening a product delivery loop.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: idea-to-deploy: turn this onboarding idea into a scoped plan, implementation handoff, QA gate, and release path.
- Expected behavior: Prepare the idea-to-release lane while keeping implementation, QA, and deploy evidence observed-only.
- Why: The request spans product shaping through deploy readiness instead of a single task.

Bad example:

- Prompt: idea-to-deploy: treat casual chat or unaccepted work as if this workflow already produced verified results.
- Expected behavior: Ask a clarification question or route to a narrower workflow instead of forcing `idea-to-deploy`.
- Why: The request lacks the required inputs or would overclaim work that Hermes did not observe.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.



## Use When

Use when Hermes should carry a product or app idea through shaping, decision gates, plan acceptance, executor handoff, verification, release readiness, deploy, and monitoring boundaries, including a fresh or empty repository that needs the greenfield bootstrap pass (git, license, README, agent context file, CI skeleton) before delivery work starts.

    Strong routing signals: `idea-to-deploy`, `idea to deploy`, `from idea to deploy`, `plan to deploy`, `idea to launch`, `ship this idea`, `ship this feature`, `launch this feature`, `product delivery loop`, `app delivery loop`, `complete product loop`, `end-to-end app operation`, `ship this idea to production`, `bootstrap the project`, `bootstrap this project`, `bootstrap a new project`, `scaffold a new project`, `set up a new repo`, `완제품 루프`, `아이디어부터 배포`, `기획부터 배포`, `출시까지`, `앱 운영 루프`, `서비스로 만들어서 배포`, `아이디어를 서비스로`, `배포까지 가보자`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `delivery`
Phase: `app-delivery-loop`
Quality tier: `delivery-gated`
Reasoning demand: `heavy`

Quality bar:

- Name the idea, user value, decision owner, non-goals, and success metric before planning delivery.
- Expose idea, decision, plan, handoff, verification, release, deploy, and monitor stages as separate status steps.
- Prepare coding handoffs only after plan acceptance and selected executor/runtime choice.
- Mark deploy, monitoring, and rollback as unobserved until the wrapper or operator records evidence.
- For a fresh, empty, or newly `git init`-ed target that is expected to outlive the session, run the greenfield bootstrap pass before or alongside delivery planning - load `references/project-bootstrap.md` for the six-step order (git and .gitignore, LICENSE, README, agent context file, CI skeleton, docs/ seed) and its per-file verify line; explicitly skip it for throwaway or scratch work instead of silently running it.

Required inputs:

- product idea
- target user or customer signal
- success metric
- repo or app context

Expected outputs:

- stage rail
- decision gates
- executor handoff criteria
- verification and deploy/monitor status boundaries

Artifact expectations:

- app delivery loop status record when the wrapper captures stage acceptance or observations

Safety rules:

- Do not claim implementation, deploy, health checks, rollback, or monitoring happened from a prepared loop.
- Keep coding, release, and monitoring observations as separate evidence gates.
- Ask for missing success metric, release scope, or executor choice before preparing a handoff.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Report actual tool results or
`not_observed` / `not_available`; never invent dispatch or host accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
