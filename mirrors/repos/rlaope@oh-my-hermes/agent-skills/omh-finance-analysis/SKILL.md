# Finance Analysis

This is an OMH `finance-analysis` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`finance-analysis` prepares a source-bounded decision brief without claiming an authoritative financial action.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is for a current quote, exchange rate, crypto price, or other live market lookup; use `live-info-operator`.
- The user wants generic exploration of a supplied CSV or table without accounting periods, controls, or finance decision framing; use `data-analysis`.
- The user asks to post journal entries, reconcile accounts, approve payments, submit tax filings, or configure an accounting system; use `connector-operator` for an explicit observed action path.
- The user wants pipeline coverage, deal health, or a seller forecast scenario rather than authoritative revenue or close reporting; use `sales-pipeline-review`.
- The user needs an enterprise or product direction decision after analysis; route that decision to `strategy-brief`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Compare Q2 actuals against budget, explain the biggest expense variances, and flag cash risks for the CFO.
- Expected behavior: Prepare the period boundary, actual-versus-plan narrative, cash-risk register, and decision questions.
- Why: The supplied finance framing needs a bounded decision brief rather than an external accounting action.

Bad example:

- Prompt: What is the USD/KRW exchange rate right now?
- Expected behavior: Route to `live-info-operator`, not `finance-analysis`.
- Why: A live exchange rate needs observed provider data rather than a finance analysis brief.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.



## Use When

Use when supplied ledger, budget, forecast, revenue, expense, cash-flow, or close context needs a bounded analysis and decision brief.

    Strong routing signals: `finance analysis`, `budget variance`, `budget vs actual`, `month-end close`, `재무 분석`, `예산 대비 실적`, `월마감`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `finance-analysis`
Quality tier: `evidence-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Separate supplied numbers, assumptions, and missing finance evidence.
- Keep decision and escalation questions explicit.

Required inputs:

- period
- supplied finance source
- decision question
- calculation assumptions

Expert clarification questions:
- `period`
  - English: What period, cutoff, reporting entity/perimeter, currency/units, accounting basis, comparator version, and close status apply?
  - Korean: 어떤 기간, 마감 기준일, 보고 법인과 범위, 통화와 단위, 회계 기준, 비교 버전, 마감 상태를 적용해야 하나요?

Expected outputs:

- finance_scope_source_record/v1
- finance_reconciliation_analysis_schedule/v1
- finance_risk_register/v1
- finance_decision_brief/v1

Artifact expectations:

- prepared finance analysis brief when a wrapper captures it

Safety rules:

- State source and calculation assumptions before presenting a variance.
- Do not imply an ERP, bank, ledger, tax, payment, or filing action occurred.

Procedure: load `references/procedure.md`.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Record actual tool results, or
`not_observed` / `not_available`, in the record; never invent dispatch or host
accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: OMH's record terms
(surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in
records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask
about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn,
offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
