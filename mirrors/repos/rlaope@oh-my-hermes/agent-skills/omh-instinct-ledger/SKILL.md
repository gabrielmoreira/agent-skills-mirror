# Instinct Ledger

This is an OMH `instinct-ledger` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`instinct-ledger` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and receive a structured, evidence-bounded OMH operating surface instead of ad hoc narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: instinct-ledger turn these repeated OMH review lessons into project-scoped instincts and show which ones could be promoted globally.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_instinct_ledger` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: instinct-ledger silently install hooks, learn from every prompt, and mutate all skills globally.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared OMH guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Each instinct is atomic: one trigger, one action, one scope, confidence, evidence refs, and review state.
- Project-specific conventions, global practices, project/global promotion candidates, imports, and exports are separated.
- No hooks, memory writes, skill edits, global promotion, import/export, or behavior-change claims are made without observed approval and implementation evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the request is a single missed route or run trace, route to workflow-learning first.
- If the request is to mutate durable rules, prompts, skills, or AGENTS guidance, route to rules-distill or implementation after review approval.
- If evidence comes from a stuck run, use agent-debug before converting lessons into instincts.



## Use When

Use when Hermes should review repeated observations, user corrections, workflow lessons, or failure patterns as atomic project-scoped or global instinct candidates with confidence, evidence, promotion, import, or export decisions.

Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `heavy`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- instinct_ledger_plan/v1
- instinct_candidate/v1
- project_instinct_scope_map/v1
- instinct_promotion_review/v1
- instinct_export_review/v1 when requested

Artifact expectations:

- instinct_candidate/v1 with trigger, action, confidence, domain, scope, source evidence, non-goals, and review state
- project_instinct_scope_map/v1 separating project, global, imported, and promotion-candidate instincts
- instinct_promotion_review/v1 with repeated evidence, confidence threshold, conflicts, and approval state
- instinct_export_review/v1 with redaction, destination, import/export trust gaps, and raw-observation exclusion when requested

Safety rules:

- An instinct ledger is not hook installation, automatic observation, model training, hidden memory mutation, skill mutation, prompt mutation, global rule promotion, import, export, or proof that future behavior changed. Record only reviewed candidate instincts, confidence, scope, promotion state, and evidence gaps.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Report actual tool results or
`not_observed` / `not_available`; never invent dispatch or host accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
