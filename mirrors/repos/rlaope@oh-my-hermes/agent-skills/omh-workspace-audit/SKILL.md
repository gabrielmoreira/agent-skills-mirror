# Workspace Audit

This is an OMH `workspace-audit` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`workspace-audit` gives OMH an ECC-inspired but OMH-native front door for understanding a large agent workspace before strengthening it, without turning inventory into hidden mutation or runtime proof.

## Do Not Use When

- The user already named a concrete implementation task with files and acceptance criteria; use the coding handoff or delivery workflow.
- The request is local OMH installation health only; use `doctor`.
- The request is a source acquisition or current web lookup; use `source-finder` or `research`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: workspace-audit OMH에 스킬/프롬프트/플러그인 표면이 어디 비어있는지 먼저 점검해줘.
- Expected behavior: Prepare workspace_audit_plan/v1, observed surface_inventory/v1, gap matrix, redacted config findings, and downstream workflow recommendation.
- Why: The user asks for repo/workspace capability strengthening based on observed local surfaces.

Bad example:

- Prompt: workspace-audit 발견한 config 파일을 바로 고치고 secret 값도 출력해줘.
- Expected behavior: Refuse secret disclosure, keep the audit read-only, and prepare a separate remediation handoff if needed.
- Why: Workspace audit is inventory and risk mapping, not unsafe config mutation or secret extraction.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.



## Use When

Use when Hermes should inspect the local repo/workspace/operator surface and produce a safe inventory, risk map, and gap list before planning, routing, or feature strengthening.

    Strong routing signals: `workspace-audit`, `workspace audit`, `repo surface audit`, `repository surface audit`, `workspace surface audit`, `repo inventory`, `surface inventory`, `skill inventory`, `prompt inventory`, `plugin inventory`, `mcp inventory`, `hook inventory`, `config audit`, `what are we missing`, `audit this repo`, `레포 감사`, `워크스페이스 감사`, `설정 감사`, `스킬 인벤토리`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `workspace-audit`
Quality tier: `workspace-audit-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the audit scope, root, exclusions, and downstream decision before inspecting.
- Separate discovered surfaces, inferred relationships, missing evidence, risks, and candidate fixes.
- Rank gaps by user impact, operational risk, and reviewability rather than by file count.
- Route code changes, setup repair, security fixes, or skill updates into later explicit workflows.

Required inputs:

- workspace or repo root
- audit scope: repo, skills, prompts, plugins, MCP/tools, hooks, config, docs, runtime artifacts
- known constraints such as no secrets, no network, or read-only mode
- desired downstream decision or strengthening goal

Expected outputs:

- workspace_audit_plan/v1
- surface_inventory/v1
- capability_gap_matrix/v1
- config_security_findings/v1
- downstream_workflow_recommendation/v1
- not-evidence boundary

Artifact expectations:

- workspace_audit_plan/v1 with target root, scopes, exclusions, and read-only boundary
- surface_inventory/v1 with repo, skill, prompt, plugin, MCP/tool, hook, config, docs, and runtime surfaces when observed
- capability_gap_matrix/v1 with missing, duplicate, stale, risky, and high-leverage strengthening candidates
- redacted config_security_findings/v1 when secrets, permissions, or external integrations are mentioned

Safety rules:

- Do not mutate repo files, installed skills, prompts, configs, plugins, MCP servers, hooks, secrets, or runtime state from the audit lane.
- Never print secret values; record only redacted key names, file paths, and risk categories.
- Do not claim a surface exists, is loaded, or is reachable unless file, CLI, wrapper, or supplied evidence was observed.
- Keep audit findings separate from implementation, setup repair, security remediation, or skill mutation.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Report actual tool results or
`not_observed` / `not_available`; never invent dispatch or host accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
