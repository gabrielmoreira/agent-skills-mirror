# Commit Pr Authoring

This is an OMH `commit-pr-authoring` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`commit-pr-authoring` exists because nothing in the catalog authored the commit or the PR body. `code-review` reads a commit message as a thing to review and `github-event-ops` routes PR events, so the text an engineer writes several times a day had no owner, and nothing applied the observed-versus-prepared split to it.

## First Steps

- Read the PR template and the recent log, and record the convention before drafting.
- Build the evidence ledger: each command, observed with its exit status or not_observed.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is to find defects in the diff or judge whether the change is ready; use `code-review`.
- The request routes an incoming pull-request, issue, or CI webhook event; use `github-event-ops`.
- The request turns a chat report into a GitHub issue; use `github-issue-intake`.
- The request is release notes or product copy for readers outside the repository; use `content-operator`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: write the commit message for this change, the unit tests ran but I did not run the e2e suite
- Expected behavior: Read the log's subject shape and trailers, record the unit test command as observed and the e2e suite as not_observed, and draft the message with the unit tests under `Tested:` and the e2e suite under `Not-tested:`.
- Why: The ledger decides which line each command lands on, not the wording of the request.

Bad example:

- Prompt: say the integration tests pass, they will once CI runs
- Expected behavior: Keep the integration tests under `Not-tested:` until an observed run exists, and say CI has not been observed.
- Why: A prediction worded as a result is exactly what `Tested:` must not carry.

## Completion Checklist

- The convention read names the template and log sample it drew from.
- Every `Tested:` entry maps to an observed ledger row with its exit status.
- Every prepared, skipped, or unobserved command is under `Not-tested:` with its reason.
- Nothing was committed, pushed, or opened by OMH.

## Recovery Notes

- If no run records exist, draft with an empty `Tested:` and every command under `Not-tested:`, and ask for the observed output.
- If the repository has no template or visible convention, say so and use a plain subject and body rather than importing one.



## Use When

Use when a change is ready to record and the user wants its commit message or pull-request body written: the repository's template and recent log read first, the subject and body in that convention, the trailers the repo requires, and a `Tested:` line that lists only commands observed to run, with everything prepared but not run under `Not-tested:`. OMH prepares the text; the commit, the push, and the PR are the user's or the executor's.

    Strong routing signals: `commit-pr-authoring`, `commit message`, `commit messages`, `write the commit message`, `draft the commit message`, `commit body`, `squash message`, `pr body`, `pr description`, `pull request body`, `pull request description`, `draft the pr`, `write the pr`, `pr template`, `tested trailer`, `not-tested trailer`, `lore trailers`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `verification`
Phase: `commit-pr-authoring`
Quality tier: `evidence-ledger-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Read the template and at least the last few commits before writing a word, and record what was found.
- Build the evidence ledger first; the `Tested:` and validation sections are projections of it, not prose.
- Write the subject in the repository's shape and the body as why the change exists, not a restated diff.
- Load `references/commit-and-pr-conventions.md` for trailer, sign-off, and template-section mapping instead of improvising them.
- Put `Closes #N` on its own line only when every success criterion of that issue is met.

Required inputs:

- the change: the diff, the staged files, or the branch compared with its base
- the repository's PR template and a sample of its recent commit log
- the commands that ran for this change, each with its observed exit status
- the commands that were prepared, planned, or skipped, and why
- the issue or goal the change closes, when there is one

Expected outputs:

- repo_convention_read/v1
- evidence_ledger/v1
- commit_message_draft/v1
- pr_body_draft/v1 when a PR is being opened

Artifact expectations:

- repo_convention_read/v1 names the template path, the subject shape and trailers seen in the recent log, and the sign-off rule, or says which of them was not found
- evidence_ledger/v1 lists every command with observed or not_observed; observed carries the exit status and where it was seen
- commit_message_draft/v1 and pr_body_draft/v1 take `Tested:` and the validation section only from observed ledger rows

Safety rules:

- List a command under `Tested:` only when the evidence ledger records it as observed; a command that was prepared, planned, or described as passing without a run record goes under `Not-tested:`, whatever the wording says.
- Never commit, amend, push, or open the PR; OMH prepares the text and the user or the executor records it.
- Read the repository's own template and recent log before drafting; impose no convention the repository does not use.
- Do not claim CI, review, or merge state in the text unless it was observed, and name what was not.
- Never put credentials, tokens, private URLs, or raw transcripts into a commit message or PR body.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Record actual tool results, or
`not_observed` / `not_available`, in the record; never invent dispatch or host
accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: OMH's record terms
(surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in
records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask
about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn,
offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
