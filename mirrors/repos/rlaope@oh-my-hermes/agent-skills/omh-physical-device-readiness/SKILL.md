# Physical Device Readiness

This is an OMH `physical-device-readiness` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`physical-device-readiness` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: physical-device-readiness check Snapmaker printer safety with camera gate, slicer dry-run, heat command approval, and emergency-stop evidence before printing.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_physical_device_readiness` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: physical-device-readiness start the printer, heat the bed, flip relays, and claim the robot is safe without observed operator approval or device telemetry.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared OMH guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Device scope, actuator and hazard classes, sensor/camera gates, operator approval, dry-run policy, emergency stop, and stop condition are explicit.
- Physical actions, heat commands, relay toggles, robot movement, print starts, camera inspections, and telemetry readings are marked observed, missing, risky, or not_observed.
- Route external APIs or provider setup to external-connector-readiness, terminal commands to command-operator, safety concerns to security-safety-review, visual/camera checks to visual-qa, and missing tools to toolbelt-readiness.
- Do not claim device movement, heat, print, relay, robot, camera, sensor, or emergency-stop success without observed device-trial evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the device, workspace, actuator, or authority is unclear, keep readiness blocked until the missing safety context is named.
- If the user asks to execute commands, move hardware, heat a bed/nozzle, flip a relay, or start a print, route to command-operator or connector-operator and require observed operator approval before any execution claim.
- If camera or telemetry evidence is required but unavailable, route to visual-qa or toolbelt-readiness and keep the physical device readiness card prepared_not_observed.



## Use When

Use before preparing or adopting a workflow that could move, heat, print, actuate, unlock, or otherwise affect physical devices so safety envelope, sensor/camera gates, dry-run policy, operator approval, emergency stop, and observation requirements are explicit.

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `device-readiness`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- physical_device_readiness_card/v1
- device_safety_envelope/v1
- hazard_and_actuator_inventory/v1
- sensor_camera_gate_policy/v1
- operator_approval_policy/v1
- dry_run_and_simulation_policy/v1
- emergency_stop_and_rollback_plan/v1
- device_trial_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- physical_device_readiness_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- device_safety_envelope/v1 with device, workspace, hazards, actuator classes, human/property risk, owner, authority, and stop condition
- hazard_and_actuator_inventory/v1 separating motion, heat, pressure, electrical, relay, network, credential, and environmental risks
- sensor_camera_gate_policy/v1 for camera/OCR, sensor telemetry, stale readings, manual inspection, and blocked/no-camera fallback
- operator_approval_policy/v1 with explicit human authority, confirmation moment, disallowed autonomous actions, and emergency contact or stop owner
- dry_run_and_simulation_policy/v1 for slicer/G-code dry-runs, command previews, mock relays, simulated robot paths, and no-hardware trial mode
- emergency_stop_and_rollback_plan/v1 with stop command, power/network isolation, recovery boundary, and abort condition
- device_trial_manifest/v1 only when real telemetry, camera capture id, dry-run output, command transcript, operator confirmation, or hardware observation is recorded

Safety rules:

- A physical device readiness card is not device discovery, network pairing, credential validation, slicer output, G-code safety, camera inspection, sensor reading, relay actuation, robot movement, heat command, print start, emergency stop test, or successful hardware trial evidence unless observed device-trial evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Record actual tool results, or
`not_observed` / `not_available`, in the record; never invent dispatch or host
accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: OMH's record terms
(surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in
records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask
about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn,
offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
