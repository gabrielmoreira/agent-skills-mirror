# Design Quality Gate

This is an OMH `design-quality-gate` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`design-quality-gate` makes high-stakes visual deliverables premium and trustworthy by treating taste, content, layout, accessibility, and render QA as first-class evidence.

## Do Not Use When

- Basic image prompt card only; use `img-summary`.
- The artifact is a throwaway probe whose quality is irrelevant to the decision it answers; use `decision-prototype`.
- Ordinary file packaging/export plan only; use `materials-package` or `deliverable-package`.
- Pure backend, CLI, data, or text-only research with no visual surface.
- The user asks to claim deployment, export, publication, or visual QA without evidence.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: design-quality-gate make this landing page and deck premium and verified.
- Expected behavior: Prepare design_quality_gate/v1 with references, comparative_quality_rubric/v1, surface_quality_matrix/v1, hierarchy, layout plan, visual QA checklist, route, and evidence boundaries.
- Why: The request asks for superior visual quality and publishing readiness.

Bad example:

- Prompt: design-quality-gate say the PDF and website look amazing because the plan says so.
- Expected behavior: Require rendered PDF/page screenshots or mark visual QA as not_observed.
- Why: A quality brief is not render, visual QA, export, deployment, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The surface, audience, source content, baseline/reference bar, and artifact type are named.
- The comparative_quality_rubric/v1 explains how the result must beat ordinary output.
- The surface_quality_matrix/v1 covers web, deck/PPT, PDF/poster, accessibility, and CJK-relevant checks as applicable.
- Prepared quality gates, generated artifacts, visual QA, export, publication, approval, and delivery remain separate states.
- The next action names whether to revise content, prepare implementation/export handoff, gather render evidence, or report blocked QA.

## Recovery Notes

- If the baseline or references are missing, prepare the gate with an explicit comparative-quality gap instead of calling the result premium.
- If render QA is unavailable, keep PASS unavailable and ask for the smallest screenshot, deck/PDF render, or operator observation that proves the target surface.



## Use When

Use when web UI, decks, PDFs, posters, or visual packages must beat ordinary output on content, taste, layout, accessibility, and render QA.

    Strong routing signals: `design-quality-gate`, `design quality gate`, `ui ux pro max`, `design pro max`, `frontend pro max`, `visual qa pro`, `premium design`, `high quality design`, `beautiful website`, `frontend publishing`, `publishing quality`, `layout validation`, `ppt design quality`, `pdf design quality`, `デザイン品質ゲート`, `公開品質のデザイン`, `デザインの品質基準`, `웹사이트 디자인`, `프론트엔드 퍼블리싱`, `레이아웃 검증`, `더 뛰어나게`, `고퀄`, `设计质量门禁`, `发布级设计`, `设计质量标准`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `materials`
Phase: `design-quality-gate`
Quality tier: `design-pro-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Define superior design quality with references, audience, hierarchy, style, and measurable QA gates. The bar is named, not relative: what a senior product designer at a top-tier product company (the Linear/Stripe/Supabase class) would sign off on — technically clean but flat output fails it. Load `references/design-critique-rubric.md` and judge every axis with named evidence.
- State why the result should be better than ordinary output, including content depth, visual hierarchy, spacing, typography, and interaction or export polish.
- Review content accuracy and hierarchy before visual polish.
- Use design-system/reference rules for web, deck, PDF, and poster surfaces.
- Reject generic AI slop: weak hierarchy, cramped copy, flat templates, one-note palettes, and unverified exports.
- Require fresh visual QA for pages, slides, states, viewports, and CJK-heavy regions before PASS.

Required inputs:

- surface/channel
- audience and purpose
- source content or gaps
- style references
- ordinary-output baseline or competitor/reference quality bar
- viewport/page/export constraints
- observed render QA for completion claims

Expected outputs:

- design_quality_gate/v1
- content_quality_review/v1
- surface_quality_matrix/v1
- comparative_quality_rubric/v1
- layout_validation_plan/v1
- visual_qa_evidence/v1 when observed
- publishing_readiness/v1
- downstream route: frontend, materials-package, img-summary, or deliverable-package

Artifact expectations:

- design_quality_gate/v1 when prepared
- surface_quality_matrix/v1 with web: responsive viewport, deck/PPT: slide rhythm, PDF/poster: print-safe, and accessibility/CJK checks
- comparative_quality_rubric/v1 that names how this should be better than ordinary output
- visual_qa_evidence/v1 only from fresh screenshots/renders/observations
- export/publish evidence only when observed

Safety rules:

- Require references/rubric plus fresh render QA before PASS.
- Never claim PPTX, PDF, deployment, poster export, image generation, or publication without observed evidence.
- Separate content, taste, layout, accessibility, render fidelity, and delivery checks.
- Route web to frontend, binary files to materials/deliverable package, and image cards to img-summary.
- For Korean/CJK text, awkward breaks, clipped glyphs, orphan particles, or tiny copy block visual QA.
- Do not call a result high-quality unless it is compared against a named ordinary-output baseline or references.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Report actual tool results or
`not_observed` / `not_available`; never invent dispatch or host accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
