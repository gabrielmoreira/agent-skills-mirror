# Sales Pipeline Review

This is an OMH `sales-pipeline-review` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`sales-pipeline-review` prepares evidence-bounded portfolio pipeline, forecast, and follow-up reviews from supplied CRM snapshots without replacing a CRM, mutating records, or claiming revenue.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is single-account discovery, qualification, buyer hypotheses, outreach drafting, or one opportunity's next step; use `sales-development`.
- The user wants a weekly status, release-risk, or operating review with no sales stages, forecast categories, or deal records; use `ops-review`.
- The user needs authoritative revenue, bookings, budget-variance, or close reporting rather than a pipeline scenario; use `finance-analysis`.
- The user wants generic exploration or calculation on a supplied table with no stage, forecast, or deal-health semantics; use `data-analysis`.
- The supplied material is qualitative customer feedback, call notes, or survey text rather than opportunity records; use `feedback-triage`.
- The user asks to update Salesforce or HubSpot, store or sync CRM data, send alerts or outreach, or change an opportunity; use `connector-operator` with explicit object, field, and authority.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Here is this week's pipeline export as of Monday 09:00; review deal health, slipped close dates, and whether the commit forecast holds up against last quarter's calls.
- Expected behavior: Validate as-of time, currency, amount and stage semantics first, then prepare health, forecast-state, and calibration findings with owned follow-ups and proposed CRM corrections.
- Why: The request is portfolio-level pipeline and forecast review over a supplied snapshot with a stated as-of time.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Write discovery questions for the Northwind opportunity and draft the follow-up email.
- Expected behavior: Route to `sales-development`, not `sales-pipeline-review`.
- Why: A single account's discovery, qualification, and outreach draft has no portfolio, aging, or forecast-calibration objective.

## Completion Checklist

- The scope disposition is recorded before any figure: `HOLD` names the blocking gap, otherwise freshness, currency basis, amount and stage semantics, duplicates, and owners are confirmed from supplied data.
- Health, forecast, and annex outputs cite supplied record references, keep stage, seller forecast, scenario, and observed commitment separate, and mark calibration or an annex `unavailable` or `unsupported` instead of filling it.
- The handoff lists owner, due date, exit criterion, and evidence per follow-up, keeps every CRM correction proposed with an approval state, and reports mutation, storage, sync, alerts, and outreach as `not_observed` unless a connector result was observed.

## Recovery Notes

- If the snapshot fails scope validation, return `HOLD` naming the exact missing definition, conversion basis, owner, or duplicate set and ask for it; do not rank or total partial data.
- If prior forecasts or outcomes are absent, keep calibration `unavailable`; if an annex has no supporting evidence, emit it as `unsupported` with the gap named rather than omitting it.
- If a connector is unavailable, keep every CRM correction proposed and every alert or message unsent, and name the connector boundary as the next observable step.



## Use When

Use when a sales leader or business owner supplies a bounded CRM export or pipeline snapshot and needs recurring portfolio review: evidence scope and freshness, stage and forecast definitions, movement and aging, stale or slipped deals, exit-criteria gaps, next-step quality, concentration, forecast scenarios and prior-forecast calibration, optional won/lost or renewal-risk learning, and an owned follow-up handoff.

    Strong routing signals: `sales-pipeline-review`, `sales pipeline review`, `pipeline review`, `pipeline health`, `pipeline coverage`, `deal review`, `deal health`, `sales forecast review`, `forecast call`, `forecast calibration`, `seller forecast`, `stale deals`, `slipped deals`, `renewal risk review`, `win loss review`, `파이프라인 리뷰`, `영업 예측 보정`, `딜 리뷰`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `sales-pipeline-review`
Quality tier: `decision-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Separate stage, seller forecast, model-derived scenario, and observed buyer commitment in every forecast statement.
- Cite the supplied record reference behind every exception, slip, stall, concentration, and proposed correction.
- Emit calibration only from matched prior snapshots and observed outcomes; otherwise state that it is unavailable.

Required inputs:

- pipeline snapshot
- as-of time and review horizon
- currency, amount, stage, and forecast definitions
- prior forecast and actuals
- decision owner

Expert clarification questions:
- `pipeline snapshot`
  - English: Which CRM export or pipeline snapshot is supplied, with its opaque source reference, included motions, owners, cohort, record count, and known data-quality gaps such as duplicates or missing owners?
  - Korean: 어떤 CRM 내보내기 파일 또는 파이프라인 스냅샷이 제공되며, 출처 참조, 포함된 영업 방식, 담당자, 코호트, 레코드 수, 중복이나 담당자 누락 같은 알려진 데이터 품질 결함은 무엇인가요?

Expected outputs:

- sales_pipeline_scope/v1
- sales_pipeline_health/v1
- sales_forecast_assessment/v1
- sales_outcome_learning_annex/v1
- sales_renewal_risk_annex/v1
- sales_pipeline_handoff/v1

Artifact expectations:

- prepared sales pipeline review brief when a wrapper captures it
- durable artifacts hold bounded aggregates, opaque source references, and only the account identifiers an approved handoff needs; raw export rows and message content are not persisted by default

Safety rules:

- Treat a missing or stale as-of time, undefined stage or forecast semantics, mixed currencies without an observed conversion basis, unknown amount meaning, duplicate opportunities, or missing owners as `HOLD`, never as an input to a calculation.
- Do not claim CRM storage, sync, mutation, dashboards, alerts, outreach, booked revenue, or seller or buyer commitments; a proposed correction is not a change and a scenario is not a promise.
- Consume the organization's supplied stage, category, probability, amount, and close-date definitions; never impose a vendor schema or a default probability table.
- Persist bounded aggregates and opaque source references only; raw CRM exports and message content stay out of durable artifacts unless the user explicitly approves a scoped exception.

Procedure: load `references/procedure.md`.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Report actual tool results or
`not_observed` / `not_available`; never invent dispatch or host accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
