# olares-cli shared rules

Foundation for every other `olares-cli` skill. Every business verb under `cluster` / `files` / `market` / `settings` / `dashboard` rides the active profile's token. **Read this first.**

> **This skill also hosts the cross-skill platform model** in [references/olares-platform.md](references/olares-platform.md) — the userspace storage model, uid-1000 run identity, system-managed `drive/Home` dirs, app/namespace & networking, system middleware, and version/semver. `files` / `chart` / `cluster` link there (one hop) instead of re-describing it. That reference is pure platform model and needs no login.

> **It also hosts the application state machine** in [references/olares-platform-appstate.md](references/olares-platform-appstate.md) — app-service's lifecycle states/transitions, per-state allowed operations, backend fail TTLs, single-download serialization, what `running` actually proves, and why `progress` is unreliable. `market` / `chart` / `doctor` link there instead of re-stating these backend facts. Also pure platform contract, no login.

> **Source of truth for flags & syntax is always `olares-cli profile --help`.** This file only carries what `--help` cannot give: the profile mental model, agent-driven login flow, token-storage backends, refresh semantics, and the error → fix matrix.

## When to use

- First time operating on an Olares / a given Olares ID (not logged in yet) — set up the profile
- Switching identity between several Olares IDs
- Any `olares-cli` command failed with an auth error (token invalidated / not logged in / 2FA required)
- Keywords: Olares ID, profile, login, 2FA/TOTP, refresh token, keychain, `server rejected the access token`, `refresh token ... became invalid`, `no access token`, `already authenticated`

## Skill suite map (routing source of truth)

The olares-cli skills ship and install as one suite; each owns a distinct slice. This is the canonical intent->skill map — a skill's own `## When to use` lists its scope and points here for everything else.

| Skill | Owns | Reach for it when |
|---|---|---|
| [`olares-shared`](SKILL.md) | Profile / login / token refresh / auth-error recovery; hosts the platform model | logging in, switching Olares ID, any auth error |
| [`olares-market`](../olares-market/SKILL.md) | App-store lifecycle: install / uninstall / upgrade / clone / stop / resume / cancel; `--mine`; chart upload | installing or managing an app's lifecycle |
| [`olares-settings`](../olares-settings/SKILL.md) | Post-install config (Settings SPA): app entrance / domain / env / policy, users, VPN, network, backup / restore, integrations | changing config of an installed app or the system |
| [`olares-cluster`](../olares-cluster/SKILL.md) | K8s runtime view: pods / workloads / jobs / cronjobs / nodes / namespaces; logs; scale / restart / delete | inspecting or operating running K8s objects |
| [`olares-dashboard`](../olares-dashboard/SKILL.md) | Resource metrics & health: CPU / memory / disk / network / pods / GPU / fan / ranking | "what's the usage / what's eating CPU" |
| [`olares-files`](../olares-files/SKILL.md) | Per-user file API: drive / sync / cache / external; upload / download; share; SMB / NFS; compress / extract; Seafile | browsing or moving files / drives |
| [`olares-knowledge`](../olares-knowledge/SKILL.md) | `knowledge download` task centre (create / list / pause / resume / cancel / remove / inspect / prefs); Settings `/download` edge; Olares >= 1.12.7 | managing URL/yt-dlp/aria2 download *tasks* (not top-level `download`, not `files download`) |
| [`olares-search`](../olares-search/SKILL.md) | Full-content search (Desktop "Text Search") over the per-user index: Drive files + Sync libraries; plus `search app` to find an installed app by title | finding a file by its content / keyword, or finding an installed app by name (not lifecycle inventory — that's `market`) |
| [`olares-chart`](../olares-chart/SKILL.md) | Local chart authoring + deploy to your Olares: from-compose / lint / package, then upload + install | authoring, validating, or deploying your own chart |
| [`olares-publish`](../olares-publish/SKILL.md) | Public Market distribution: market-ready metadata / multi-arch, the beclab/apps PR, paid apps | listing / submitting / selling an app on the public Market |
| [`olares-doctor`](../olares-doctor/SKILL.md) | Runtime diagnosis: symptom -> root cause for an app that won't install, won't start, crashes, is `running` but unreachable, or is slow; orchestrates `cluster` / `dashboard` / `market` to gather evidence | an app or the system is misbehaving and you need to find out why — both catalog (`market`) and dev (`chart`) apps hand runtime failures here |

> **The four-skill develop->deploy->debug combo:** porting and running your own app usually loads [`olares-chart`](../olares-chart/SKILL.md) (package + deploy + chart fixes), [`olares-market`](../olares-market/SKILL.md) (lifecycle), this `olares-shared` (platform facts), and [`olares-doctor`](../olares-doctor/SKILL.md) (runtime diagnosis) together. `chart` owns fixes that mean editing your chart; `doctor` owns figuring out the root cause regardless of who deployed the app.

> Host-side maintenance (cluster install, node join, OS upgrade, GPU drivers) is NOT a skill — it's the kubeconfig-based `olares-cli node` / `os` / `gpu` trees, separate from this profile-based suite.

## Profile model

One profile = one Olares instance + one user identity, keyed by **olaresId** (e.g. `alice@olares.com`). Each profile owns its own access_token / refresh_token pair, stored in the OS keychain.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `olares-cli profile login` | Mode A — password (+ TOTP if 2FA is on); auto-creates the profile on first run |
| `olares-cli profile import` | Mode B — bootstrap an access_token from an existing refresh_token |
| `olares-cli profile list` | List every profile (NAME / OLARES-ID / STATUS / VERSION), mark the current one, show login status; `--refresh-version` re-reads the current profile's cached backend version |
| `olares-cli profile use <name\|->` | Switch the current profile; `-` reverts to the previous one (like `cd -`) |
| `olares-cli profile remove <name>` | Delete a profile and its stored token in one shot |

> **There is no `auth login` / `auth logout` namespace and no per-invocation `--profile` override flag.** Everything lives under `profile`. "Logout" is `profile remove`. Identity is whichever profile is currently selected; to target a different one, run `olares-cli profile use <name>` first.

## Login modes

### Mode A — password (+ optional TOTP)

```bash
olares-cli profile login --olares-id <olaresId>
```

- Interactive: prompts for password (echo disabled); prompts for TOTP if 2FA is enabled.
- Scripted: pipe via `--password-stdin`; if 2FA is on, you MUST also pass `--totp <code>` because there is no second prompt. (Passwords only ever go through the TTY or `--password-stdin` — see Security rules.)

### Mode B — existing refresh_token

```bash
olares-cli profile import --olares-id <olaresId> --refresh-token "$OLARES_REFRESH_TOKEN"
```

Exchanges the refresh_token for an access_token once via `/api/refresh` and writes both to the keychain. **Read the token from an env var or secret manager — never inline plaintext.**

### Agent-driven login (recommended)

When you (an AI agent) drive the login on the user's behalf, do NOT pass password / TOTP as command-line arguments. Spawn `olares-cli profile login --olares-id <id>` as a background process so it parks at the password prompt, forward the prompt to the user, and read its output after the command exits to confirm success.

## Switching and inspecting profiles

`profile list` output:

```
   NAME             OLARES-ID              STATUS        VERSION
*  alice            alice@olares.com       logged-in     1.12.6
   bob              bob@olares.com         expired        1.12.5
   eve              eve@olares.com         invalidated   -
   frank            frank@olares.com       never         -
```

| STATUS | Meaning | Recovery |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `logged-in` | Token valid — JWT exp is in the future, **or** the JWT carries no exp claim (can't verify locally; trust until the server says no) | — (usable; just run the command) |
| `expired` | Access-token JWT exp is in the past | **Usually none — the next command auto-refreshes** (see Automatic token refresh). `profile login` only if that refresh leg is itself rejected (which flips it to `invalidated`) |
| `invalidated` | Server explicitly rejected the refresh leg (`/api/refresh` returned 401/403/459) | `profile login` directly (no need to `profile remove` first) |
| `never` | No token has ever been stored | `profile login` or `profile import` |
| `unknown` / `logged-in (unparseable token)` | Token store couldn't be read / the JWT couldn't be parsed | re-run `profile login` if it persists |

STATUS reflects only what the local token store can prove without a network call (no `(Xh Ym)` time-to-expiry is printed). The `VERSION` column is the cached Olares backend version (`-` until a login eager-fetch or a version-aware command populates it; `--refresh-version` re-reads it). The leading `*` marks the current profile; `profile use` accepts either the NAME alias or the olaresId.

## Auth-readiness gate

**The single rule every skill uses to decide "proceed, or stop for login?" — proceed by default.** Other skills link here instead of re-deriving it; the STATUS table above is the source for what each value means.

- **Pre-flight (you ran `profile list` first):** proceed on `logged-in` and `expired`. An `expired` access token auto-refreshes on the first call (see Automatic token refresh), so it is NOT a reason to stop. Stop only when the CLI has no credential it can send or refresh: `never` (no profile) or `invalidated` (refresh grant dead). The rare corrupt states — `unknown` (token store unreadable) and `logged-in (unparseable token)` — also fail at command time and recover the same way (`profile login`).
- **Reactive (a command came back with an auth error):** don't pre-empt it — run the command and read the result. Only the typed errors `ErrNotLoggedIn` (`no access token …`) and `ErrTokenInvalidated` (`refresh token … became invalid`) mean "must log in" → `profile login` / `import`. A 401/403/459 is auto-refreshed and retried once for you; a network / 5xx error is transient — surface it, do not preemptively log in, and do not build retry loops on top of auth errors.

`ResolveProfile` hands even a stale JWT to the refreshing transport and no command pre-flights on the STATUS string, which is why `expired` never blocks. When the decision is **stop**, tell the user which command to run — never log in on their behalf without being asked (see the agent-driven login flow above).

## Token storage

| OS | Backend | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| darwin | macOS Keychain | service `olares-cli`, account = olaresId |
| linux | AES-256-GCM file | under `~/.local/share/olares-cli/` |
| windows | DPAPI | `HKCU\Software\OlaresCli\keychain` |

After `login` / `import` succeeds, the CLI prints `token stored via <backend> (service "olares-cli", account "<id>")`. If the backend resolves to `file-fallback` (sandboxed / CI environments), be aware the token now sits in a file with **different security properties than the system keychain**.

> **The plaintext `~/.olares-cli/tokens.json` from older builds is deprecated** — if a user upgraded and suddenly appears "logged out", `profile login` is the fix.

## Re-authentication rules

`profile login` and `profile import` both reject the case "a still-valid token already exists for this olaresId" — to force-overwrite, run `profile remove <id>` first. Expired / invalidated / never-logged-in profiles get the new token written in place; this lets scripts call `login` after `invalidated` without an extra `remove` step.

## Automatic token refresh

**The CLI rotates expired access_tokens transparently.** Users do NOT need to run `profile login` just because their access_token aged out — only when the *refresh_token itself* becomes invalid. This is why a `profile list` STATUS of `expired` is not a blocker: the very next business command swaps the stale token out and succeeds. For the proceed/stop decision built on this, see the Auth-readiness gate above.

- Replayable requests (every JSON verb, `files cat`, `files download`, `files rm`, `market` verbs, …): on 401/403/459 the transport calls `/api/refresh` and retries once with the new token. (459 is Olares' edge / Authelia "auth failed" status, treated like 401/403.)
- Streaming uploads (`files upload` chunks): pre-decode the JWT exp; if within 60s of expiry, refresh BEFORE sending, because once a `*os.File` chunk is consumed it can't be replayed on a 401.

Across goroutines AND across concurrent `olares-cli` processes, `/api/refresh` is hit at most once per stale token (in-process mutex + cross-process flock).

> **Do not implement custom retry/backoff loops on top of auth errors.** Once you see `ErrTokenInvalidated` or `ErrNotLoggedIn`, only `profile login` / `profile import` will help.

## Auth error recovery table

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|-------------------------|---------|-----|
| `refresh token for <id> became invalid at <ts>` | `/api/refresh` returned 401/403 — the grant is dead | `olares-cli profile login --olares-id <id>` |
| `no access token for <id>` | Profile selected but keychain has no entry | `olares-cli profile login` or `profile import` |
| `server rejected the access token (HTTP 401)` / `(HTTP 403)` / `(HTTP 459)` | After auto-refresh the server still rejects (rare); 459 = Olares edge (Authelia) "auth failed", handled like 401/403 | `olares-cli profile login --olares-id <id>` |
| `--olares-id is required` | login / import invoked without olaresId | Add `--olares-id <id>` |
| `already authenticated for <id> (expires in ...)` | Still-valid token exists | `olares-cli profile remove <id>` then re-run |
| `a token is already stored for <id> but its expiry can't be determined client-side` | Token present but JWT carries no exp claim | `profile remove <id>` then re-run |
| `two-factor authentication required: re-run with --totp <code>` | 2FA on, non-TTY context | Re-run with `--totp <code>`, or run interactively |
| `password is empty` / `TOTP code is empty` | stdin / TTY returned an empty string | Check for premature EOF or an empty pipe |
| `profile <name> not found` | `profile use` / `profile remove` referenced an unknown profile | `profile list` to see the actual names |

> These auth errors are deterministic — pick the fix from the table above (see also the auto-refresh rules), don't loop.

## Security rules

- **Never** invent a `--password <plaintext>` argument (it does not exist). Passwords go through the TTY or `--password-stdin` fed by a secret pipe.
- **Never** echo `access_token` / `refresh_token` to the terminal. When passing a refresh_token to `profile import`, source it from an environment variable: `--refresh-token "$OLARES_REFRESH_TOKEN"`.
- **Confirm intent before write/delete actions** (`profile remove`, `files rm`, `files upload --overwrite`, `cluster pod delete`, …). Do not act unilaterally on the user's behalf.
- **TOTP is not a password** — it is single-use and short-lived, so the CLI echoes it to make manual entry less error-prone. Never persist a TOTP in a shared script.
