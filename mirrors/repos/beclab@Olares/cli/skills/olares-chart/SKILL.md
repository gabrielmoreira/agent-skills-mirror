description: "Help a developer turn their own code or any open-source project into an app that runs on their own Olares, or is published to the public Olares Market. Three coupled axes: packaging the container image, authoring/refining the Olares app chart (OlaresManifest), and the release target — local-run on your own Olares vs market-distribute to the catalog. Use when deploying a repo, docker-compose, or Helm chart to Olares, packaging an Olares app, wiring storage / system middleware / entrances / env / GPU, or fixing a failed install (ImagePullBackOff, permission denied / EACCES, app won't start)."

# Deploy your code or any project to Olares — local-run or Market

> **Source of truth for flags is always `olares-cli chart <verb> --help`.** This file only carries what `--help` cannot: the three coupled axes of a port, where to start on each, the per-axis concerns to get right, and the gotchas `lint` won't catch.

> **Porting baseline: Olares >= 1.12.6.** This skill targets Olares >= 1.12.6 (other `olares-cli` features have no such floor). Check the target with `olares-cli profile list` (VERSION column). Full version rules — `apiVersion: v3`, the several chart version fields, `type: system` dependency — are in [references/olares-chart-versioning.md](references/olares-chart-versioning.md).

> **Platform model (read once, no login needed for authoring).** The porting decisions below rely on the Olares storage model, uid-1000 run identity, app/namespace & networking, system middleware, and version model — all defined once in [`../olares-shared/references/olares-platform.md`](../olares-shared/references/olares-platform.md). **Packaging an image and authoring/validating the chart need no profile login.** Only **pushing to a real Olares to test** (`market upload` + `install`) requires login.

## The shape of the work — three axes

Porting an app is **not** a fixed `from-compose → lint → publish` pipeline — it is driving three **orthogonal but coupled** axes each to its own *ready* state, looping back across the coupling edges as constraints surface (an image's baked-in uid/paths constrain the chart's mounts/permissions; a deploy constraint can send you back to rebuild the image). Start wherever your app already stands, not at a fixed step 1.

- **Packaging — the image:** the app built into a pullable, arch-correct artifact. Olares only pulls, never builds.
- **Deployment — the chart:** a `lint`-passing OlaresManifest + templates. `from-compose` is only **one** way in.
- **Publishing — the release target:** who consumes it — **local-run** on your own Olares, or **market-distribute** to the public catalog. This choice gates how strict the other two must be.

**First move (not a pipeline):** settle the release target (Axis 3) → locate where the app already sits on the packaging and deployment state tables → drive the concerns to ready, looping as constraints surface.

## Axis 1 — Packaging (the image)

Olares **pulls images from a registry and never builds from source**, so every workload must reference a publicly pullable, node-arch-correct image. Image work is **agent-driven**: ask which registry the developer uses (Docker Hub / ghcr), check docker is usable and already logged in, then **build + push yourself** — only the credential entry (`docker login`) stays manual, and only when not already authenticated ([references/olares-chart-image.md](references/olares-chart-image.md)). No Olares login needed for this.

| Packaging state | Do this | Ready when |
|---|---|---|
| No Dockerfile (just source) | author a Dockerfile, then build+push | — |
| Dockerfile, but no pullable image | build+push (Docker Hub or ghcr) | — |
| A pullable image exists | check its arch; rebuild if it doesn't match the target (node arch for local-run; multi-arch for market) | every workload has a pullable, arch-correct image |

## Axis 2 — Deployment (the chart)

The target is a `lint`-passing Olares chart. `from-compose` (kompose) is **just one entry method** for a compose-based start — a bare repo, a generic Helm chart, or an already-Olares chart each begin elsewhere. Local authoring (`from-compose` / `lint` / `package`) needs **no login**.

| Deployment state | Do this | Ready when |
|---|---|---|
| Source only (no compose) | author a docker-compose from the code ([compose.md](references/olares-chart-compose.md)) | — |
| A docker-compose | `chart from-compose` then refine ([from-compose.md](references/olares-chart-from-compose.md)) | — |
| A generic Helm chart (no OlaresManifest) | hand-author `OlaresManifest.yaml` + refine (skip `from-compose`) | — |
| Already an Olares chart | go straight to validation | a chart that passes `chart lint` |

## Axis 3 — Publishing (the release target)

Decide **who consumes the chart** and what "done" means **before** refining — it gates image arch and metadata depth. Infer from user language; ask if ambiguous. Full decision tree: [references/olares-chart-publish-targets.md](references/olares-chart-publish-targets.md).

| Release target | User signals | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **local-run** (default for most users) | "run on my Olares", "upload and install", "just for myself" | `lint` OK → package → upload + install reaches `running` on the developer's Olares |
| **market-distribute** | "publish to Market", "submit to beclab/apps", "上架" | local validation passes **plus** market-ready metadata/images/arch → PR merged into `beclab/apps:main` |

**What differs by target:** **image arch** (local-run = single-arch for this node via `cluster node list`; market = multi-arch + `spec.supportArch`); **metadata depth** (local = stub OK if `lint` passes; market = full metadata, dual-version categories, listing images, developer links); and the **publish path** (local = upload + install; market = the same validation first, then a `beclab/apps` PR). Functional refinement (storage / middleware / entrances) is **identical for both**.

## The concerns to get right (reflect on these per axis)

`from-compose` produces a chart that **lints but is not yet a good Olares app**. These are the same concerns viewed three ways — what triggers them, what they let you do, and when they're done — collapsed into one row each. Drive each to "get this right", and loop back here when its trigger reappears.

| Axis | Concern | Get this right | Loop back when | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| packaging | **Image** | pullable, pinned to a version tag (never `:latest`), arch-correct (per release target — see Axis 3) | `ImagePullBackOff` / wrong arch, or a deploy constraint forces a rebuild | [image.md](references/olares-chart-image.md) |
| packaging+deployment | **Run identity** | process runs as uid 1000; `spec.runAsUser: true`; initContainer `chown` for root-owned volumes; no root main on non-trusted images (OPA) | EACCES on appData/appCache/userData, admission denies a root third-party image | [run-as-user.md](references/olares-chart-run-as-user.md) |
| deployment | **Storage** | every compose volume mapped to the right userspace area (Data / Cache / Home / Common / External), `permission` declared to match, leftover kompose PVCs deleted | a volume isn't persisting or lands in the wrong area | [manifest.md](references/olares-chart-manifest.md) §2 |
| deployment | **Middleware & deps** | no bundled `postgres`/`redis`/`mongo`/…; wired to system middleware; SQLite→Postgres where supported; companion apps as `type: application` deps | a bundled db/queue is still in the chart, or a companion should be a dependency | [middleware.md](references/olares-chart-middleware.md) |
| deployment | **Env** | app config in `envs[]` (v3 `valueFrom`, no inline `OLARES_USER`); install-time `required` prompts; middleware/system/user vars mapped via `.Values.olaresEnv`; platform render context (identity, domain, userspace, oidc, middleware) consumed via `.Values.*` | install fails on `appenv` 422, or config must be user-supplied | [env.md](references/olares-chart-env.md), [env-defaults.md](references/olares-chart-env-defaults.md), [system-values.md](references/olares-chart-system-values.md) |
| deployment | **Entrances & ports** | ≥1 `entrances[]`; HTTP via entrances, non-HTTP via `ports[]`; internal-only services `invisible: true` | a service is unreachable, or an internal port is exposed as a desktop entrance | [manifest.md](references/olares-chart-manifest.md) §4 |
| packaging+deployment | **GPU / models** | build a CUDA image without a local GPU (custom-kernel arch flags); download model weights via initContainer into the shared `appCommon` Hugging Face cache | AI app needs a CUDA build, model provisioning, or a shared model cache | [gpu.md](references/olares-chart-gpu.md) |
| deployment | **Accelerator** | declare `spec.accelerator` modes (nvidia/amd-gpu/apple-m/cpu/…) per what the repo supports; set `requiredGPUMemory`; a sane CPU/memory envelope | GPU/accelerator app needs a resource envelope, or `lint` flags `spec.resources` | [accelerator.md](references/olares-chart-accelerator.md) |
| packaging+deployment | **DinD** | a privileged `beclab/docker` daemon sidecar (`ENABLE_DIND`, `DOCKER_HOST`) while the main container stays non-privileged | a terminal/agent app must run `docker` / `docker compose` | [dind.md](references/olares-chart-dind.md) |
| deployment | **Shared backend** | `apiVersion: v3` ⇒ admin-only install into `<app>-shared`; consumers reach it over cross-namespace Service DNS; flag the admin-install to the user | a heavy/accelerator backend serves many users over shared data | [shared.md](references/olares-chart-shared.md) |
| deployment | **Version rules** | `apiVersion: v3`; `olaresManifest.version` 0.8.0 vs 0.12.0; `metadata.version` == `Chart.yaml` `version`; `options.dependencies` `olares >=1.12.6-0` (`type: system`) | install rejects the manifest, or behavior differs by Olares version | [versioning.md](references/olares-chart-versioning.md) |
| deployment | **Metadata** | depth gated by release target (see Axis 3); market needs full `metadata.*` + `spec.{developer,website,sourceCode,submitter,fullDescription}` + listing images | publishing to market, or `lint`/ingest flags missing metadata | [manifest.md](references/olares-chart-manifest.md) §1 |
| deployment | **Validate-local** | `olares-cli chart lint ./<app>` passes, then `chart package` | a refinement changed the manifest/templates | [lint.md](references/olares-chart-lint.md) |
| publishing | **Publish-local** | `market upload` + `market install`, then diagnose from logs (login required) | proving the chart actually runs on the developer's Olares | [publish-verify.md](references/olares-chart-publish-verify.md) |
| publishing | **Publish-market** | market-ready checklist + a PR to `beclab/apps` | local validation passed and the user wants a public listing | [market-submit.md](references/olares-chart-market-submit.md) |
| publishing | **Publish-paid** | `price.yaml` at OAC root + `VERIFIABLE_CREDENTIAL` env wired in; on-chain RSA registration + Merchant app (developer does the on-chain/secret steps) | a market app should be pay-to-download (Closed Beta, Olares >=1.12.3) | [paid-apps.md](references/olares-chart-paid-apps.md) |

> **Publish-local** leans on sibling skills: [`olares-shared`](../olares-shared/SKILL.md) (login check), [`olares-market`](../olares-market/SKILL.md) (upload / install / cleanup), [`olares-cluster`](../olares-cluster/SKILL.md) (logs). **Never log in or upload on the developer's behalf without asking first.** One way to sequence the whole assembly (and the file tree `from-compose` emits) lives in [references/olares-chart-workflow.md](references/olares-chart-workflow.md) — a reference, not a required order.

## Routing (this skill vs siblings)

Use this skill to **author/validate your own** Olares chart from a repo, compose, or Helm chart. Hand off to a sibling when the task is not authoring:

| User intent | Where |
|---|---|
| Turn a repo / compose / Helm chart into an Olares app, or validate one you authored | ✅ this skill |
| Run the app on **my own** Olares (upload + install) | ✅ this skill — release target **local-run** |
| Publish / list the app on the **public** Olares Market | ✅ this skill — release target **market-distribute** → [market-submit.md](references/olares-chart-market-submit.md) |
| Sell the app (pay-to-download / paid listing) | ✅ this skill — [paid-apps.md](references/olares-chart-paid-apps.md) |
| "My chart won't install / the app won't start — why?" | ✅ this skill — diagnosis step of [publish-verify.md](references/olares-chart-publish-verify.md) (then [`olares-cluster`](../olares-cluster/SKILL.md) for deeper log digging) |
| "Just install / upgrade an existing catalog app" (not validating your own chart) | [`olares-market`](../olares-market/SKILL.md) |
| "Inspect pods / logs of an unrelated running app" | [`olares-cluster`](../olares-cluster/SKILL.md) |

## CLI verbs

The only `olares-cli chart` subcommands (source of truth: `--help`). Everything else above is docker or sibling skills.

| Verb | What it does | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `from-compose` (alias `init`) | kompose-convert compose file(s) into an Olares chart skeleton | [from-compose.md](references/olares-chart-from-compose.md) |
| `lint` | validate a chart dir / `.tgz` with the Market ingest pipeline | [lint.md](references/olares-chart-lint.md) |
| `package` | package a chart dir into a `<name>-<version>.tgz` for upload (mirrors `helm package`, no helm binary needed) | [workflow.md](references/olares-chart-workflow.md) (D4 / M3) |

## Special porting patterns & official ports (beclab/apps)

Most of this skill assumes a web app with an HTTP entrance. When the upstream doesn't fit, match a known pattern first; if still unsure, see how the official ports solved it.

- **Headless CLI / service (no web UI)** — no GUI to point an entrance at: add a web-terminal sidecar as a **visible** entrance + expose the API/MCP port as an `invisible` internal entrance. → [archetypes.md](references/olares-chart-archetypes.md)
- **GUI desktop app (browser-streamed)** — a native Linux desktop app with no web UI: wrap it in a web-desktop base image (Selkies default, or KasmVNC for old hardware/static UIs), point one visible window entrance at HTTP `:3000`, and device-gate optional iGPU/VAAPI acceleration on `.Values.deviceName`. → [archetypes.md](references/olares-chart-archetypes.md)
- **Still no idea?** look at how the official ports wire it (manifest fields, entrance shapes, middleware/app dependencies, GPU specs) in [beclab/apps](https://github.com/beclab/apps) before guessing:

```bash
gh search code --repo beclab/apps <keyword>      # find charts using a pattern (e.g. type: application, accelerator, appCommon)
# then browse https://github.com/beclab/apps/tree/main/<app> — its OlaresManifest.yaml + templates/
```

This is the canonical source for cross-app wiring (how a dependency app is reached, real `entrances`/`ports`, accelerator modes) that this skill intentionally does not hardcode.

**When picking a reference app, skip these — they mislead more than they help:**

- **Apps with a `.suspend` (or `.remove`) control file in the OAC root** — suspended / no longer distributed; not a current, reliable pattern.
- **Legacy v2 shared / cluster-scoped charts** that express sharing with `spec.subCharts[].shared: true` + `options.appScope.clusterScoped: true` + `appRef` (the `ollamaserver`/`ollamav2` shape). For Olares >= 1.12.6 this is superseded by `apiVersion: v3`; copy the shared-app pattern from a current `v3` app, not from these. See [shared.md](references/olares-chart-shared.md).

## Gotchas (what `lint` won't catch)

`lint` validates structure, not Olares correctness. Beyond the concerns table above, these blind spots bite and are entirely on you:

- **`metadata.name` must match the chart folder and `Chart.yaml` `name`**, and be `^[a-z][a-z0-9]{0,29}$`. Rename all three together.
- **Declared `.Values.userspace.appData`/`appCache`/`userData` mounts MUST have the matching `permission` field**, or the app-data cross-check fails.
- **`hostPath` volumes + rolling updates are incompatible** — replace host mounts with the userspace volumes above.
