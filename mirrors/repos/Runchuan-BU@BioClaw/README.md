**BioClaw** brings the power of computational biology directly into WhatsApp group chats. Researchers can run BLAST searches, render protein structures, generate publication-quality plots, perform sequencing QC, and search the literature — all through natural language messages.

Built on the [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) architecture with bioinformatics tools and skills from the [STELLA](https://github.com/zaixizhang/STELLA) project, powered by the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-sdk).

<p align="center">
  New BioClaw-compatible skills can be developed either directly in BioClaw or in <a href="https://github.com/zongtingwei/Bioclaw_Skills_Hub">Bioclaw_Skills_Hub</a>, which can serve as a staging space for early iteration and testing before useful skills are promoted into the main BioClaw repository. Skills that prove practical and stable may later be integrated into BioClaw itself. To get newly promoted skills and other updates from BioClaw, pull the latest version of this repository with <code>git pull</code>.

## Overview

The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. Researchers frequently need to switch between command-line bioinformatics tools, visualization software, databases, and literature search engines — often across different machines and environments.

**BioClaw** addresses this by providing a conversational interface to a comprehensive bioinformatics toolkit. By messaging `@Bioclaw` in a WhatsApp group, researchers can:

- **Sequence Analysis** — Run BLAST searches against NCBI databases, align reads with BWA/minimap2, and call variants
- **Quality Control** — Generate FastQC reports on sequencing data with automated interpretation
- **Structural Biology** — Fetch and render 3D protein structures from PDB with PyMOL
- **Data Visualization** — Create volcano plots, heatmaps, and expression figures from CSV data
- **Literature Search** — Query PubMed for recent papers with structured summaries
- **Image-based Wet-Lab Interpretation** — Analyze gel/blot photos captured from camera or uploaded in chat (e.g., SDS-PAGE lane quality and target-band checks)
- **Workspace Management** — Triage files, recommend analysis steps, and manage shared group workspaces

Results — including images, plots, and structured reports — are delivered directly back to the chat.

## What's New

Recent updates make BioClaw feel much closer to a real multi-chat research workspace:

- **Multiple web chats, each with its own memory** — the local web UI now lets you open separate threads like ChatGPT, so one chat can stay on literature search while another focuses on QC or plotting.
- **A built-in control layer in chat** — you can now manage the current thread directly in chat with commands like `/status`, `/doctor`, `/threads`, `/new`, `/use`, `/rename`, `/archive`, `/workspace`, `/provider`, and `/model`.
- **Per-thread working directory** — `/dir` lets each thread remember its own default folder inside the workspace, so different chats can work in different subdirectories without stepping on each other.
- **Reusable shortcuts for recurring workflows** — `/commands` and `/alias` let you save common prompts as short commands, so repeated lab routines do not need to be typed from scratch every time.
- **Skill visibility and preference control** — `/skills` shows the installed BioClaw skill modules and lets you mark preferred ones for the current thread or agent.
- **Better local web management** — the browser UI now has a thread list, rename/archive controls, and a lightweight management panel for status and diagnostics.
- **Quick OpenRouter health check** — `npm run check:openrouter` sends a tiny test request using your current `.env` so you can tell whether the key works before debugging the full app.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **macOS / Linux / Windows** (Windows requires PowerShell 5.1+)
- Node.js 20+
- Docker Desktop
- Anthropic API key or OpenRouter API key

### Installation

**One-command setup** (recommended for first-time users):

<details>
<summary><b>macOS / Linux</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Runchuan-BU/BioClaw.git
cd BioClaw
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows (PowerShell)</b></summary>

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Runchuan-BU/BioClaw.git
cd BioClaw
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup.ps1
```

</details>

The setup script will check prerequisites, install dependencies, build the Docker image, and walk you through API key configuration interactively.

**Manual setup:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Runchuan-BU/BioClaw.git
cd BioClaw
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # Edit with your API keys (see model section below)
docker build --no-cache -t bioclaw-agent:latest container/ # uncomment Dockerfile image source if you meet 100 errors.
npm start
```

### Model Provider Configuration

BioClaw now supports two provider paths:

- **Anthropic** — default, keeps the original Claude Agent SDK flow
- **OpenRouter / OpenAI-compatible** — optional path for OpenRouter and similar `/chat/completions` providers

Create a `.env` file in the project root and choose **one** of the following setups.

**Option A — Anthropic (default)**

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
```

**Option B — OpenRouter** (Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude, GPT, and more)

```bash
MODEL_PROVIDER=openrouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
OPENROUTER_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1
```

Popular model IDs: `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`. Full list: [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)

**Note:** Use models that support [tool calling](https://openrouter.ai/models?supported_parameters=tools) (e.g. DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude). Session history is preserved within a container session; after idle timeout, a new container starts with a fresh context.

**Generic OpenAI-compatible setup**

```bash
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai-compatible
OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL=https://your-provider.example/v1
OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL=your-model-name
```

After updating `.env`, restart BioClaw:

```bash
npm run dev
```

When a container starts, `docker logs <container-name>` will show which provider path is active.

### Usage

In any connected chat, simply message:

```
@Bioclaw <your request>
```

## Messaging channels

Supported platforms include **WhatsApp** (default), **Feishu (Lark)**, **WeCom**, **Discord**, **Slack** (Socket Mode), **WeChat** (fully supported), **QQ** and optional **local web** (browser) chat. Full setup steps, env vars, and disabling channels are in **[docs/CHANNELS.md](docs/CHANNELS.md)** (简体中文：[docs/CHANNELS.zh-CN.md](docs/CHANNELS.zh-CN.md)).

**Key design principles (inherited from NanoClaw):**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Container Isolation** | Each conversation group runs in its own Docker container with pre-installed bioinformatics tools |
| **Filesystem IPC** | Text and image results are communicated between the agent and orchestrator via the filesystem |
| **Per-Group State** | SQLite database tracks messages, sessions, and group-specific workspaces |
| **Channel Agnostic** | Channels self-register at startup; the orchestrator connects whichever ones have credentials |

**Biomedical capabilities (attributed to STELLA):**

The bioinformatics tool suite and domain-specific skills — including sequence analysis, structural biology, literature mining, and data visualization — draw from the tool ecosystem developed in the [STELLA](https://github.com/zaixizhang/STELLA) project, a self-evolving multi-agent framework for biomedical research.

## Skills & Skills Hub

BioClaw uses a two-tier skill system:

- **Built-in skills** — ~25 core skills bundled in the container image (BLAST search, differential expression, single-cell preprocessing, database queries, PubMed search, etc.). Always available, no setup needed.
- **[Skills Hub](https://github.com/zongtingwei/Bioclaw_Skills_Hub)** — A community-maintained repository with 70+ specialized skills across 10 domains (protein design, spatial transcriptomics, EHR analysis, multi-omics integration, etc.).

The agent automatically discovers Hub skills at runtime. When a user's task isn't covered by built-in skills, the agent fetches the relevant skill definition from the Hub via GitHub, caches it locally, and executes it — no manual installation required.

To contribute new skills, see the [Skills Hub contributing guide](https://github.com/zongtingwei/Bioclaw_Skills_Hub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Skills that prove stable and widely useful may be promoted into BioClaw's built-in set.

## Notebook Export

Every successful agent run automatically generates a reproducible Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`).
Notebooks are saved to:

```
groups/{workspace}/notebooks/{timestamp}.ipynb
```

For example, a Slack DM conversation might produce:
```
groups/slack-E1KYFDKN/notebooks/2026-04-01T07-31-54.ipynb
```

Each notebook contains:
- **Header cell** — date, workspace, and the original user prompt
- **Code cells** — Python scripts and bash commands the agent executed
- **Markdown cells** — agent reasoning, file writes, and analysis summaries

Open notebooks in VS Code (with the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)), JupyterLab, or any `.ipynb`-compatible viewer.
