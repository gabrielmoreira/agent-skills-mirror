# ✂️ gi-splice

You are **gi-splice**, a ClawBio agent that calls the **Genomic Intelligence** splice-site model. Given a gene-body sequence, it returns called donor/acceptor sites and per-position probabilities via the hosted API.

> ⚠️ **Remote inference — opt-in required.** Unlike most ClawBio skills, this skill uploads your FASTA sequence to the hosted Genomic Intelligence API at `https://api.genomicintelligence.ai`. The skill refuses to run unless `GI_API_KEY` is set — `cp .env.example .env && set -a && source .env && set +a` to use the shared ClawBio hackathon key (50 concurrent / 120 rpm), or request an individual key at contact@genomicintelligence.ai. Prefer a browser? The same models run interactively at <https://genomicintelligence.ai>. **Do not submit identifiable patient data** without an appropriate data-use agreement.

## Trigger

**Fire this skill when the user says any of:**
- "predict splice sites in this gene"
- "find splice donors/acceptors"
- "score this for cryptic splice sites"
- "splice site prediction"
- "gi-splice", "G0 splice"
- "where does this transcript splice?"

**Do NOT fire when:**
- The user asks for full transcript structure (multi-exon annotation) → `gi-annotation`
- The user asks about variant effect on splicing → use `variant-annotation` (VEP) or chain `gi-splice` ref/alt comparisons

## Why This Exists

- **Without it**: SpliceAI / similar require local GPU + weights + careful preprocessing.
- **With it**: One CLI call → ranked site list with positions and probabilities, in ~1 s.
- **Why ClawBio**: Hosted G0 BigBird inference plus ClawBio's reproducibility bundle and chaining (`gi-splice` → `gi-annotation` → variant interpretation).

## API Backed

`POST https://api.genomicintelligence.ai/v1/tasks/splice/predict` — default model `g0-splice-bigbird` (G0 BigBird transformer; long-context handling for full gene bodies).

## Workflow

1. **Parse**: single-record FASTA via `clawbio.gi.gi_client.read_fasta`.
2. **Authenticate**: `--api-key` → `GI_API_KEY` → bundled hackathon key.
3. **POST** the full gene body to `/v1/tasks/splice/predict`.
4. **Render**: `report.md` + `result.json` + `reproducibility/`.

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Demo — bundled HBB gene body
python skills/gi-splice/gi_splice.py --demo --output /tmp/gi-splice-demo

# Your own FASTA
python skills/gi-splice/gi_splice.py --input my_gene.fa --output report_dir

# Via ClawBio runner
python clawbio.py run gi-splice --demo
```

## Demo

```bash
python clawbio.py run gi-splice --demo
```

Bundled fixture is HBB (β-globin) gene body, reverse-complemented to gene-sense. HBB has 3 exons / 2 introns; on the coding strand the model calls ~8 sites (≈4 donor + 4 acceptor, including lower-confidence alternates).

## Authentication

Same as other gi-* skills: `GI_API_KEY` env overrides the bundled hackathon key.

## Gotchas

- **Submit gene-sense, not genomic-sense.** Minus-strand genes need RC'd input. The bundled HBB fixture demonstrates this — its FASTA header notes `strand:-1` (gene-sense for the minus-strand HBB gene).
- **Full gene body, not just an exon.** The model uses long context to disambiguate; truncated input degrades accuracy.
- **Donor/acceptor pairs.** The model emits independent site calls. Pair them downstream by ordering + strand consistency if you need intron boundaries.
- **Hackathon key is shared** — `GI_API_KEY` for serious work.

## Integration with Bio Orchestrator

Routes here on: "splice site", "splice donor", "splice acceptor", "predict splicing".

Chains with: `variant-annotation` (intersect calls with VEP splice consequences), `gi-annotation` (cross-check against predicted exon boundaries).

## Safety

Research tool. Not a clinical assay.
