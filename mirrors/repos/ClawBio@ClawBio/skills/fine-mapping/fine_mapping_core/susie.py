"""
susie.py — SuSiE fine-mapping backed by the sushie package.

Delegates the Sum of Single Effects model (Wang et al. 2020, JRSS-B
doi:10.1111/rssb.12388) to sushie (mancusolab/sushie), a published,
maintained JAX implementation, via its summary-statistics interface
``infer_sushie_ss`` run with a single ancestry. This replaced the previous
hand-rolled numpy IBSS implementation.

Requires the ``fine-mapping`` extra: ``uv sync --extra fine-mapping``.

    """Run SuSiE fine-mapping on one locus via sushie.

    The keyword set is a contract with the external clawbio_bench harness
    (biostochastics/clawbio_bench, drivers/finemapping_driver.py), which
    imports this function directly and always passes ``w``, ``max_iter``,
    ``tol`` and ``min_purity``. Do not remove or rename them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z : (p,) z-score vector
    R : (p, p) LD correlation matrix
    n : effective sample size
    L : maximum number of causal signals
    w : prior effect-size variance. Seeds sushie's ``effect_var``; sushie
        then re-estimates it by EM each iteration, so this is a starting
        point rather than a fixed prior as in ABF.
    max_iter : maximum optimization iterations
    tol : ELBO convergence tolerance
    min_purity : minimum pairwise |r| for a credible set to be kept.
        Forwarded to sushie's ``purity`` pruning, so it governs which
        signals survive, not only how they are flagged downstream. sushie
        requires 0 < min_purity < 1.
    coverage : credible-set coverage. Forwarded to sushie's ``threshold``
        so fit-time pruning and downstream set construction use the same
        value. sushie requires 0 < coverage < 1.

    Returns
    -------
    dict with keys:
        alpha     : (k, p) posterior weight matrix over the k kept signals
                    (each row sums to 1)
        mu        : (k, p) conditional posterior mean effect per signal,
                    E[b | included], from sushie ``post_mean``
        mu2       : (k, p) conditional posterior second moment, E[b^2]
                    (not the variance), from sushie ``post_mean_sq``
                    Units: mu/mu2 are on sushie's standardised effect-size
                    scale, NOT susieR ``susie_rss`` z-units — do not compare
                    them to ``r * z`` shrinkage formulas.
        pip       : (p,) posterior inclusion probabilities
        elbo      : list of ELBO values per iteration
        converged : bool
        n_iter    : int
