I need your help with an analysis to an action in browser and its related changes.
We recorded a user's interactions with his browser for the current task. His ultimate goal is:

{{ ultimate_goal }}

So here is the basic information of the action for the current sub-task that a user takes in browser:

{{ action }}

note that "target" is the targeted element for this action.
This is what happened in the browser DOM before and after this action:

{{ change_events }}

note that in some "nodeinfo", #rme mean there are more children inside this tag pairs but we hide it for shorting the context.
You should think about what is the purpose of this action by the user, and think about what is the goal this user is trying to achieve in the current sub-task. You don't need to tell me your thought process. You only need to give me a final reply which is a concise and formatted instruction in JSON to make another agent to understand this sub-goal and reproduce the action. Subgoal should be generalized and fit the ultimate goal. Only include one action in the subgoal, do not explain action. Only include one action (verb) in the subgoal! If you want to use "and", only keep the first action. e.g.:
{"next_goal": "Enter 'Singapore' as the destination in the search input field."}
{"next_goal": "Click on the button with text 'Dinners'"}
{"next_goal": "Click on the first item"}
