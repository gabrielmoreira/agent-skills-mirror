# transport

`SdkBackendTransport` is the implementation of the core's `BackendTransport`
port. Every hosted-backend request the core makes, from `BackendClient`,
`IntegrationClient` and the other backend callers, passes through it and rides
the vendored `tinyhumans-sdk`'s raw HTTP primitive. The SDK owns route policy
(its unexposed-route registry) and the credential header shapes the backend
expects; this module wires the SDK to the core's request type and translates
the SDK's errors back into the core's.

## How it works

`SdkBackendTransport::new()` builds two `reqwest::Client`s, one per
`TransportProfile` (`Api` and `Integrations`), with
`crate::backend::headers::build_backend_client`. That gives every request the
platform TLS backend, the profile's timeout (120 s or 60 s), disabled
redirects and the attribution headers (`x-core-version`, `x-tauri-version`,
`x-sdk-name`) as defaults.

For each request the core hands over a `BackendRequest` (method, path, base
URL, optional query and body, the resolved credential, the profile and whether
to unwrap the `{success, data}` envelope). `send_json` then:

1. builds a `TinyHumansClient` for `req.base_url`, giving it the profile's
   `reqwest::Client` and the product-identity headers as SDK default headers
   (so `x-sdk-name` holds even for a client this crate did not build);
2. attaches the credential: `BackendCredential::Session` as a bearer token
   (`with_token`), `BackendCredential::ApiKey` as `x-api-key`
   (`with_api_key`), or nothing;
3. calls `sdk.raw().send(method, path, query, body, unwrap_envelope)`;
4. maps an error through `map_sdk_error(error, &method, path)`.

`send_multipart` does the same through `raw().post_multipart` for uploads
such as speech-to-text.

The transport also answers the core's configuration questions, so the core
keeps no hosted URL or header policy of its own:

| Trait method | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| `base_url(configured, ControlPlane)` | `backend::url::effective_backend_api_url` |
| `base_url(configured, Inference)` | `backend::url::effective_api_url` |
| `product_identity()` | `backend::product::product_identity()` |
| `attribution_headers()` | `backend::headers::attribution_headers()`, built fresh each call; on a malformed header value it degrades to the identity header alone |
| `http_client(profile)` | a clone of the profile's `reqwest::Client`, for callers that drive `reqwest` themselves |
| `name()` | `"tinyhumans-sdk"` |

### Error mapping

`map_sdk_error` in [`error.rs`](error.rs) maps each `tinyhumans_sdk::Error` variant onto a
`BackendTransportError` variant one for one (`Url`, `Http`, `Status`,
`Header`, `Decode`, `RouteNotExposed`, `Envelope`, with `Other` as a
catch-all), so the core's classifiers in `backend/client.rs` and the
integrations client see the same shapes they would see calling the SDK
directly.

One case gets a typed variant here because only this backend's wire behavior
says what it means: a 404 on a channel-message path
(`.../channels/<provider>/messages/<id>`).

```text
 404 on .../channels/<p>/messages/<id>
   |
   +-- method is PATCH and body contains "Cannot PATCH "
   |     (Express unmatched-route page: the backend has no edit route)
   |       -> ChannelMessageRouteMissing { provider, message_id }
   |
   +-- otherwise (handler's JSON 404: the message is gone)
           -> ChannelMessageNotFound { provider, message_id }
```

The core recovers from the two differently (`BackendApiError` variants in
`backend/client.rs`) and never reads the response body itself.

## Layout

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`mod.rs`](mod.rs) | `SdkBackendTransport` and its `BackendTransport` impl. |
| [`error.rs`](error.rs) | `map_sdk_error`, plus the channel-message path parser and the unmatched-route check. |

## Key types and entry points

- `SdkBackendTransport::new()` builds the transport; it fails only when a
  `reqwest::Client` cannot be built.
- `SdkBackendTransport::shared()` returns it as `Arc<dyn BackendTransport>`,
  ready for `openhuman_embed::__host::backend::install_backend_transport`.
- `map_sdk_error` is public (re-exported at the crate root) for code that
  calls the SDK and needs the same translation.

Most hosts never construct the transport by hand: `crate::install()` builds
one and installs it, and `RuntimeBuilder::build()` also binds it to the
runtime. A core with no transport installed still runs agents, memory, tools
and RPC, and answers backend-touching calls with
`BackendApiError::BackendUnavailable` / `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE:`.

## Boundaries

- The port (`BackendTransport`, `BackendRequest`, `BackendTransportError`,
  `BaseUrlPurpose`, `TransportProfile`) lives in
  [`crates/openhuman-core/src/backend/transport/`](../../../openhuman-core/src/backend/transport/). Credential resolution is the
  core's (`security::credentials::session_support`).
- Routes live in the vendored SDK ([`vendor/tinyhumans-sdk`](../../../../vendor/tinyhumans-sdk/),
  `tinyhumansai/tinyhumans-sdk`). A missing backend route goes into the SDK's
  route registry and is named from the core; this transport never grows a
  route implementation of its own. A route the SDK does not expose fails with
  `RouteNotExposed`.
- The hosted RPC proxies in [`../hosted/`](../hosted/README.md) do not call
  this trait. They build their own typed `TinyHumansClient` through
  `hosted::client::HostedClient`, reusing this transport's `http_client`.
- The SDK's Socket.IO client is compiled out (`default-features = false`);
  realtime stays on the core's `platform::socket`.

## Tests

[`transport_tests.rs`](transport_tests.rs) pins the wire shape against a wiremock backend: bearer
versus `x-api-key`, attribution headers, `Status` and `Envelope` mapping, and
SDK route refusal. [`channel_404_tests.rs`](channel_404_tests.rs) pins the two channel-message 404
cases.

```bash
cargo test -p openhuman-tinyhumans transport::
```
