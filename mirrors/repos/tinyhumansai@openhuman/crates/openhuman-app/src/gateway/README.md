# gateway

Routes the frontend's JSON-RPC to a core wherever that core runs. The default
is the core embedded in this process. A gateway can also point at a core
someone else runs (a URL), or at one this app provisions itself: in a Docker
container on this machine, as a process on another machine over SSH, or in a
container on another machine over SSH. The module is compiled only with the
`gateways` Cargo feature, which is on by default.

## How it works

The design rests on one seam: a gateway resolves to a URL and a bearer, and
nothing else in the app changes. The `core_rpc_endpoint`, `core_rpc_url` and
`core_rpc_token` commands in `lib.rs` answer from
`registry::current`, so `coreRpcClient`, `relay_http_rpc` and every screen
reach a remote core through the same code that reaches the embedded one. No
transport abstraction is threaded through the frontend.

### Gateway kinds

`types::GatewaySpec` has three variants:

- `Desktop` is the embedded core. A built-in record with id `desktop`
  (`Gateway::desktop`, label "This computer") is always listed first and
  cannot be replaced or deleted.
- `Remote { url, token }` is a core someone else runs. Nothing is provisioned;
  the URL is the answer.
- `Box { reach, confinement, env }` is a core this app starts with tinybox.
  `Reach` is `Local` or `Ssh(SshReach)` (destination, optional port, optional
  identity file, `accept_new_host_key`). `Confinement` is `Passthrough
  { binary, workspace }` (an ordinary process) or `Docker { image }`. The two
  axes are independent, so SSH plus Docker needs no variant of its own.
  tinybox's `namespace` and `microvm` sandboxes are not offered because they
  cannot keep a detached server running between commands.

`GatewaySpec::kind` gives a short stable word for logs and the picker badge:
`desktop`, `remote`, `docker`, `ssh`, `ssh+docker` or `local-process`.

### Provisioning a box

`provision::provision` runs four tinybox steps and reports each through a
progress callback, which the registry turns into `GatewayStatus::Activating
{ step }`:

1. Create the box (`create_box`). The spec from `box_spec` maps reach to a
   tinybox `HostRef` (`local` or `ssh`) and confinement to a `SandboxRef`
   (`passthrough` or `docker`). Docker boxes get `NetworkPolicy::Egress` and
   publish the in-box core port `CORE_PORT_IN_BOX` (7788) to a host port.
   That host port is chosen by the shell (a free local port, or a random
   ephemeral port on a remote machine) because tinybox cannot report a port
   Docker picked. Creation retries up to `PORT_ATTEMPTS` (8) times when
   Docker says the port is taken. A passthrough box publishes nothing; the
   core listens on 7788 on the target machine directly.
2. Start the core detached (`start_core`). `core_command` runs
   `<binary> serve` (or `openhuman-core serve` from the image's `PATH`) with
   `OPENHUMAN_CORE_TOKEN` set to a freshly minted bearer,
   `OPENHUMAN_CORE_HOST=0.0.0.0` and `OPENHUMAN_CORE_PORT=7788`.
3. Forward the published port back to `127.0.0.1` on this machine
   (`Host::forward`). For an SSH box the published port lives on the far
   machine, so without this step nothing is reachable.
4. Poll the unauthenticated `/health` every 250 ms for up to 120 s
   (`wait_until_healthy`). An open tunnel does not prove the core is up.

A failure at any step stops the core and destroys the box before returning,
so a failed activation leaves nothing behind. The resulting `Provisioned`
value owns the tunnel (`Forward`), the sandbox, the box id and the process id.
Dropping the `Forward` closes the tunnel, which is why the registry holds the
value for as long as the gateway is active.

### Activation and switching

`registry::activate` serializes whole activations with `ACTIVATION_LOCK`, so
the last activation to start is also the last to finish. A generation counter
stops a late progress update from a superseded activation from overwriting a
terminal `Connected` or `Failed` status.

The previous gateway is torn down only after the new one is up. A failed
activation records `GatewayStatus::Failed { reason }` and leaves the working
gateway active. `Provisioned::tear_down` stops the core and destroys the box,
logging and continuing past each failure.

At launch, and whenever nothing has been activated, `registry::current` falls
back to the embedded core. Active state is in memory only; after a restart
the app starts on the desktop gateway until the frontend activates another.
On exit, `lib.rs` calls `registry::shutdown`, which tears down any provisioned
box.

## Layout

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`mod.rs`](mod.rs) | Module declarations and the design notes. No re-exports. |
| [`types.rs`](types.rs) | `Gateway`, `GatewaySpec`, `Reach`, `SshReach`, `Confinement`, `ActiveGateway`, `GatewaySummary`, `GatewayStatus`, and `validate_remote_transport`. |
| [`store.rs`](store.rs) | Reads and writes `gateways.json` in the shell data dir (`file_logging::resolve_data_dir`). |
| [`ops.rs`](ops.rs) | `activate` decides what a spec needs; `endpoint_of` answers for non-provisioning specs; `Provisioned` and its `tear_down`. |
| [`provision.rs`](provision.rs) | The four tinybox steps, port selection and cleanup on failure. |
| [`registry.rs`](registry.rs) | The active gateway, its held-open `Provisioned`, status and the activation lock. |
| [`commands.rs`](commands.rs) | The Tauri commands. Each one resolves arguments and delegates to `store` or `registry`. |

## Key types and entry points

- `GatewaySpec` ([`types.rs`](types.rs)) is what the user configured.
- `ActiveGateway` (`types.rs`) is what activation produces: `id`, `rpc_url`,
  optional `token`. It never leaves the shell.
- `GatewaySummary` (`types.rs`) is the credential-free view the renderer gets
  from `gateway_list`: id, label and kind.
- `registry::current` ([`registry.rs`](registry.rs)) is called by `active_rpc_endpoint` in
  `lib.rs` on every endpoint lookup.
- `registry::activate` (`registry.rs`) is the only writer of the active state.

## Tauri commands

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `gateway_list` | All gateways as `GatewaySummary`, desktop first. |
| `gateway_save` | Adds or replaces a record. Does not activate. |
| `gateway_delete` | Removes a record. Deleting the active gateway does not switch away from it. |
| `gateway_activate` | Activates by id and returns nothing; the bearer stays in the shell. |
| `gateway_active` | The active gateway's id. |
| `gateway_status` | `inactive`, `activating { step }`, `connected { endpoint }` or `failed { reason }`. |

## Boundaries

- Box lifecycle, SSH reach, Docker confinement and port forwarding are
  implemented in the [`vendor/tinybox`](../../../../vendor/tinybox/) submodule (`tinyhumansai/tinybox`,
  crates `tinybox-core`, `tinybox-host`, `tinybox-ssh`, `tinybox-docker`).
  Fix behavior there, not here.
- The `openhuman-core serve` command, its bearer check and `/health` belong to
  the core and [`crates/openhuman-rpc`](../../../openhuman-rpc/).
- The frontend's gateway picker (`GatewaySection`) and its `coreMode` setting
  live in [`app/src`](../../../../app/src/).

## Gotchas

- Credentials stay in the shell. Gateway records live in `gateways.json`, not
  renderer `localStorage`, because a renderer XSS can read anything stored
  there. `gateway_list` strips the bearer, SSH destination and identity path,
  and `gateway_activate` does not return the endpoint.
- A `Remote` gateway with a bearer must use `https` unless the host is
  loopback. `store::save` enforces this through `validate_remote_transport`,
  and `core_rpc::post_json_rpc` checks it again before sending.
- A box's bearer is minted per activation and passed only as an environment
  variable, so a stored record never holds a credential for a running core.
- `store::list` returns just the desktop gateway when the file is missing or
  unreadable, while `store::save` refuses to overwrite a file it cannot parse.
- Shell-side callers that use `core_rpc::core_rpc_url_value` (the iMessage
  scanner) still reach the embedded core while a gateway is active.

## Tests

in this directory and are declared from [`mod.rs`](mod.rs).
