# flows

Saved automation workflows: the graphs a user builds on the Workflows canvas,
or that the workflow copilot builds for them in chat. This domain owns the
saved-flow lifecycle (create, edit, enable, run, resume, cancel), the bridge
from trigger events to runs, the agent tools and sub-agents that author and
suggest flows, and the adapters that let the vendored `tinyflows` engine call
real OpenHuman services. The engine itself (graph model, validation,
compilation, execution) lives in [`vendor/tinyflows/`](../../../../vendor/tinyflows/).

Callers are the JSON-RPC/CLI surface (`flows.*`, used by the Workflows UI), the
event bus (cron ticks and Composio triggers), and agents that hold the flow
tools.

## How it works

### The pieces

                              tinyflows/caps  (agent, llm, tools,
                              http, code, memory, state store)
                                         |
                                         v
                       OpenHuman services: harness, Composio,
                       native tools, memory, approval gate
```

`ops/` is the business layer. Everything else either calls into it (RPC
handlers, agent tools, the trigger subscriber) or is called by it (the store,
the engine, the capability seam).

### Saving a flow

A graph arrives as raw JSON, from the canvas, an import, a draft promotion or
an agent tool. `ops::validate_and_migrate_graph` (in [`ops/validation.rs`](./ops/validation.rs)) runs
it through `tinyflows::migrate::migrate` to upgrade older schemas, deserializes
it into a `WorkflowGraph`, and rejects anything `tinyflows::validate::validate`
refuses. Engine-compatibility checks map topology problems onto
`FlowValidationError`.

Agent-authored graphs pass one more stack, `run_builder_gates` in
[`ops/builder_gates.rs`](./ops/builder_gates.rs). It is the single definition of the author-time hard
gates, run in increasing cost order and short-circuiting on the first failure:
engine compatibility, binding resolvability, agent-ref resolvability,
connection refs ([`ops/connection_ref_gate.rs`](./ops/connection_ref_gate.rs): a `composio:<toolkit>:<id>` ref
must name a connected account of the same toolkit as the slug), tool contracts
([`ops/tool_contract_gate.rs`](./ops/tool_contract_gate.rs): the slug must exist in the live Composio catalog
and every required arg must be present), and required-arg resolvability.
`propose_workflow`, `revise_workflow`, `edit_workflow`, `save_workflow`, and the
`strict` create/update RPC path all route through it, so agent saves and UI
saves cannot validate differently. Softer findings come back as warnings
instead: [`ops/wiring_warnings.rs`](./ops/wiring_warnings.rs) flags unwired required args and bindings to
output fields the action does not produce.

`flows_create` (in [`ops/definitions.rs`](./ops/definitions.rs)) then applies two server-side rules
regardless of what the caller asked for:

1. A graph whose trigger fires without a human (`schedule`, `app_event`,
   `webhook`) is created disabled. The user has to enable it explicitly.
2. A graph with outbound side-effect nodes (`tool_call`, `http_request`,
   `code`) is forced to `require_approval = true`.

`flows_update` applies the same rules to later saves: it forces approval on
side-effect graphs, and when a graph's trigger changes from manual (or none)
to automatic it turns the flow off. `flows_duplicate` always produces a
disabled, unbound copy, and `flows_draft_promote` runs the create/update path.
No save path hands the user an armed, unattended automation. Each successful write publishes `DomainEvent::FlowChanged` so an
open canvas refetches. Updates use optimistic concurrency: a stale write comes
back as a `{ code: "version_conflict", ... }` error the UI can offer to reload.
Every graph change is kept as a revision (`flows_get_history`,
`flows_rollback`).

Drafts are separate, non-live working copies stored as files under
`<workspace>/flows/drafts/` ([`draft_store.rs`](./draft_store.rs), [`ops/drafts.rs`](./ops/drafts.rs)). Promoting a
draft runs the same create/update gates as a normal save.

### Enabling and triggers

`flows_set_enabled` (in [`ops/triggers.rs`](./ops/triggers.rs)) binds or unbinds the flow's
automatic dispatch based on its trigger node:

| Trigger kind | What enabling does |
| --- | --- |
| `schedule` | Arms a `JobType::Flow` cron job with `cron::add_flow_schedule_job`; disabling calls `cron::remove_job`. |
| `app_event` | Nothing to bind. The trigger subscriber matches Composio trigger events against enabled flows at dispatch time. |
| `webhook` | Not implemented. Enabling logs an actionable warning; incoming webhook requests are observed but never start a run. |
| `manual` and others | No automatic dispatch. |

`flows_update` rebinds a schedule when an enabled flow's trigger kind or config
changes, so a new cron expression takes effect. At boot,
`reconcile_schedule_triggers_on_boot` (called from [`core/runtime/services.rs`](../core/runtime/services.rs))
re-arms schedules for every enabled flow.

```text
 cron scheduler                 Composio webhook relay
      | FlowScheduleTick{flow_id}      | ComposioTriggerReceived{toolkit, slug}
      v                                v
 +--------------------------------------------------+
 | bus::FlowTriggerSubscriber                       |
 |  - load flow, check enabled + trigger kind       |
 |  - app_event: match toolkit/slug on every flow   |
 |  - try_acquire_dispatch(flow_id): skip if a      |
 |    trigger-driven run of this flow is in flight  |
 |  - spawn_run -> tokio task -> ops::flows_run     |
 +--------------------------------------------------+
```

### Running a flow

There are two entry points in [`ops/run.rs`](./ops/run.rs). `flows_run` blocks until the run
settles; `flows_run_detached` validates synchronously, then spawns the run and
returns `{ run_id, status: "running", detached: true }` at once. The detached
form exists because the harness caps one tool call at 120 seconds and a flow
with a research agent node easily runs longer. The UI "Run" button and the
`run_flow` agent tool use the detached path; the copilot polls `get_flow_run`.

Both share one body, `run_flow_body` in [`ops/execution.rs`](./ops/execution.rs):

```text
 prepare_flow_run      validate declared inputs, compile-check, mint thread_id
        |
 run_registry::register(thread_id)   cancel token + guard (before the id
        |                            is visible, so a cancel never races it)
 start_flow_run_row    insert flow_runs row, status "running"
 FlowRunStarted        published on the bus
        |
 run_flow_body
   RunRowFinalizer     drop guard: writes "interrupted" if the future dies
   validate_inference_readiness   fail fast when no AI provider works
   tinyflows::compiler::compile
   build_capabilities + open_flow_checkpointer
   run_with_checkpointer_journaled_observed   (raced against cancel token)
        |  FlowRunObserver persists each finished step to the run row
        v
 finalize: completed | completed_with_warnings | pending_approval |
           failed | cancelled
   record summary on the flow, Langfuse export (if usage sharing is on),
   CoreNotification with an "approve" action when approvals are pending
        |
 FlowRunFinished  ->  FlowRunDigestSubscriber, DedupCommitSubscriber
```

The whole run is scoped under
`AgentTurnOrigin::TrustedAutomation { source: Workflow { require_approval } }`
(`workflow_origin`), whatever started it. The trust argument is about the
saved, validated graph, not the caller. `input` is the free-form trigger
payload (reachable in expressions as `=run.trigger.…`); `inputs` fills the
flow's declared inputs (`=inputs.<name>`), and a bad declared input is rejected
before any run row exists.

A run that reaches a gated node without trust parks as `pending_approval`. Its
state lives in a durable SQLite checkpoint (`checkpoints.db`), so it survives a
restart. `flows_resume` (in [`ops/resume.rs`](./ops/resume.rs)) continues it, but only after
checking that the supplied `approvals` name at least one of the row's actually
pending node ids. The engine treats any resume call as approval, so this guard
is the host's enforcement. `flows_approval_manifest` computes, ahead of time,
every trust key a fully pre-authorized run would need, so the save-and-enable
card can ask once instead of parking node by node.

`flows_cancel_run` (in [`ops/run_management.rs`](./ops/run_management.rs)) signals an in-flight run
through `run_registry::cancel` and lets that run's own cancel arm write the
terminal row. For a parked or orphaned run it writes `cancelled` itself and
drops the checkpoint. Two sweeps clean up after crashes:
`sweep_orphaned_running_runs_on_boot` marks rows left `running` by a dead
process, and `sweep_expired_parked_runs` expires old parked runs.

### After a run

Three bus subscribers, all constructed in [`core/runtime/subscribers.rs`](../core/runtime/subscribers.rs), react
to run events. `FlowRunDigestSubscriber` ([`bus/run_digest.rs`](./bus/run_digest.rs)) writes a short
digest of each successful run into memory, tagged `flow:<id>` and
`flow_run_digest`, keeping the newest 50 per flow. `DedupCommitSubscriber`
([`bus/dedup_commit.rs`](./bus/dedup_commit.rs)) settles the `dedup` node's exactly-once contract: on
success it folds each node's tentative key set into its committed set; on
failure it drops the tentative keys so the items are retried. Commits are
serialized per flow. `FlowTriggerSubscriber` is the trigger bridge described
above.

### Authoring and discovery agents

Two built-in sub-agents live under `agents/`, each with an `agent.toml` and a
`prompt::build`, registered by path from the `BUILTINS` slice in
[`agent/registry/agents/loader.rs`](../agent/registry/agents/loader.rs):

- `workflow_builder` is the authoring copilot. `flows_build` (in
  [`ops/builder.rs`](./ops/builder.rs)) runs one turn of it from a structured request (create,
  revise, repair, build), streams progress onto a chat thread when asked
  ([`ops/streaming.rs`](./ops/streaming.rs)), and returns the `workflow_proposal` it produced plus its
  final text. [`ops/trail_off.rs`](./ops/trail_off.rs) detects a turn that ended in a question or a
  gate failure instead of a proposal. The overall bound is 600 seconds.
- `flow_discovery` is a read-only scout. `flows_discover` (in [`ops/discovery.rs`](./ops/discovery.rs))
  runs it over the user's data; it ends by calling `suggest_workflows`, and the
  suggestions are stored for the UI (`flows_list_suggestions`,
  `flows_dismiss_suggestion`, `flows_mark_suggestion_built`).

The human-in-the-loop rule is enforced by the tools, not the prompt. No agent
tool enables a flow. `propose_workflow`, `revise_workflow`, `edit_workflow` and
`validate_workflow` never persist. `create_workflow` and `duplicate_flow`
always produce a disabled flow, and `save_workflow` never sets `enabled` or
`require_approval` (it can auto-disable a flow whose trigger turns automatic).
`dry_run_workflow` runs a draft against `tinyflows`' mock capabilities, so no
real effect can fire. `get_tool_output_sample` is the one builder tool that
makes a real Composio call, limited to Read-scope actions on a connected
toolkit. `resume_flow_run` is `Execute`-gated because resuming lets approved
nodes fire.

The long authoring manual is a bundled skill ([`skills/mod.rs`](./skills/mod.rs), needs both the
`flows` and `skills` features): the portable `flow-authoring` pages from
`tinyflows-copilot`, registered with OpenHuman's native skill runtime. Binding
rules stay in the agent prompt; reference material the model looks up goes in
the skill.

### Flow memory

Memory has no namespaces, so a flow's memory is the set of items tagged
`flow:<id>` (plus `flows`). The tag helpers in [`memory_tools.rs`](./memory_tools.rs) (`flow_tag`,
`flow_key_tag`, `flow_meta`, `flow_filter`, `cross_flow_filter`,
`remember_keyed`, `forget_matching`, `FLOWS_TAG`) are re-exported from [`mod.rs`](./mod.rs)
so the digest subscriber, `flows_delete`, the `memory` node adapter
(`tinyflows::memory_adapter::OpenHumanMemory`) and the agent tools all tag the
same way.

### On a storage backend

With a storage backend configured (`OPENHUMAN_STORAGE_URL` / `[storage] url`,
see `crate::storage`), the catalog (`store.rs`), drafts (`draft_store.rs`),
per-flow state and the run checkpointer move off `flows/flows.db`,
`flows/drafts/` and `flows/checkpoints.db` onto the document port, in the
acting agent's scope: `tinyflows_drivers::catalog::FlowCatalogDocuments`,
`FlowStateDocuments` (through `tinyflows/state.rs`'s `FlowState`, which the
engine's `StateStore` and the dedup settlement share) and
`DriverCheckpointer`. When the scope cannot be resolved (SaaS mode with no
acting agent) flow state fails every call rather than falling back to the
local file.

## Layout

Top level:

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `mod.rs` | Module declarations and re-exports: model types from `tinyflows_catalog`, node contracts, store helpers for the seam, flow-memory helpers. |
| [`ops.rs`](./ops.rs), `ops/` | Business operations returning `Outcome<T>`. See the table below. |
| [`schemas.rs`](./schemas.rs), `schemas/`, [`schemas_handlers.rs`](./schemas_handlers.rs) | Controller schemas (split into `builder_schemas.rs`, `definition_schemas.rs`, `draft_schemas.rs`, `run_schemas.rs`) and thin handlers that load config, read params and call `ops::flows_*`. |
| [`store.rs`](./store.rs) | Binds `tinyflows_sqlite::flows` to `<workspace_dir>/flows`. Every function only substitutes the directory; anything else in a body is host policy leaking into persistence. |
| `draft_store.rs` | Same binding for `tinyflows_sqlite::drafts`. |
| [`bus.rs`](./bus.rs), `bus/` | The three subscribers: `trigger.rs`, `run_digest.rs`, `dedup_commit.rs`. |
| [`tools.rs`](./tools.rs) | `ProposeWorkflowTool` (`propose_workflow`) and `RunFlowTool` (`run_flow`). |
| [`builder_tools.rs`](./builder_tools.rs), `builder_tools/` | The 22 `workflow_builder` tools, split by role: `draft_revise.rs`, `draft_edit.rs`, `draft_validate.rs`, `flow_reads.rs`, `run_control.rs`, `persistence.rs`, `connection_reads.rs`, `catalog_search.rs`, `tool_contract.rs`, `kind_reads.rs`, `dry_run.rs`. |
| [`discovery_tools.rs`](./discovery_tools.rs) | `SuggestWorkflowsTool` (`suggest_workflows`). |
| `memory_tools.rs` | `FlowMemoryRecallTool`, `FlowMemoryRememberTool`, and the flow-memory tag helpers. |
| `agents/` | `workflow_builder/` and `flow_discovery/` built-in agent definitions and prompt builders. |
| [`catalogue.rs`](./catalogue.rs) | `flow_entries` lists saved flows as `Workflow` entries with `WorkflowScope::Flow`, so the skill catalogue and `skill_search` show one list. |
| [`node_contracts.rs`](./node_contracts.rs) | Host overlay on `tinyflows::catalog`'s node-kind contracts (which `tool_call` slugs resolve to Composio or native `oh:` tools, which trigger kinds dispatch here). |
| `skills/` | Registers the bundled `flow-authoring` skill. |
| `tinyflows/` | The capability seam. See [tinyflows/README.md](tinyflows/README.md). |

`ops/`, grouped by role:

| Group | Files |
| --- | --- |
| Definitions | `definitions.rs` (create, get, list, delete, duplicate), `updates.rs` (update, history, rollback), `validation.rs` (validate, import, migrate), `drafts.rs` |
| Triggers | `triggers.rs` (set_enabled, bind/unbind, boot reconcile) |
| Runs | `run.rs` (entry points), `execution.rs` (shared body, origin, notifications, Langfuse export), `run_rows.rs` (row writes, `RunRowFinalizer`), `resume.rs`, `run_management.rs` (cancel, list, prune, sweeps), `inference_readiness.rs` |
| Gates and warnings | `builder_gates.rs`, `connection_ref_gate.rs`, `tool_contract_gate.rs`, `wiring_warnings.rs`, `approval_manifest.rs` |
| Copilot and scout | `builder.rs`, `builder_toolset.rs`, `streaming.rs`, `trail_off.rs`, `discovery.rs` |
| Catalog reads | `catalog.rs` (tool catalog search, tool contract), `connections.rs` (connection picker, required connections) |

## Key types and entry points

- `ops::flows_run` / `ops::flows_run_detached` (`ops/run.rs`): start a run,
  blocking or fire-and-forget.
- `ops::flows_create` / `ops::flows_update` (`ops/definitions.rs`,
  [`ops/updates.rs`](./ops/updates.rs)): the save paths that enforce born-disabled and forced
  approval.
- `ops::validate_and_migrate_graph` (`ops/validation.rs`): the one
  structural-validation door.
- `run_builder_gates` (`ops/builder_gates.rs`): the agent-authored hard-gate
  stack.
- `RunRowFinalizer` ([`ops/run_rows.rs`](./ops/run_rows.rs)): drop guard that keeps a run row from
  being wedged at `running`.
- `tinyflows::build_capabilities` / `tinyflows::open_flow_checkpointer`
  ([`tinyflows/caps/`](./tinyflows/caps/)): wire the engine to OpenHuman for one run.
- `bus::FlowTriggerSubscriber` ([`bus/trigger.rs`](./bus/trigger.rs)): the trigger-to-run bridge.
- Model types, re-exported from `tinyflows_catalog` and not owned here: `Flow`,
  `FlowConnection`, `FlowDraft`, `FlowImport`, `FlowRevision`, `FlowRun`,
  `FlowRunStep`, `FlowRunTrigger`, `FlowSuggestion`, `FlowValidation`,
  `FlowValidationError`, `SuggestionStatus`, `DraftOrigin`, plus the `types`,
  `run_registry`, `build_registry` and `n8n_import` modules.

## RPC / CLI surface

All methods live in the `flows` namespace (`openhuman.flows_<name>` over
JSON-RPC), registered through `all_flows_registered_controllers()` in
[`core/all.rs`](../core/all.rs).

| Group | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Definitions | `create`, `get`, `list`, `update`, `delete`, `duplicate`, `import`, `validate`, `get_history`, `rollback`, `set_enabled` |
| Runs | `run`, `run_detached`, `resume`, `cancel_run`, `get_run`, `list_runs`, `list_all_runs`, `prune_runs`, `approval_manifest` |
| Builder | `build`, `build_cancel`, `search_tool_catalog`, `get_tool_contract`, `list_connections`, `required_connections` |
| Discovery | `discover`, `list_suggestions`, `dismiss_suggestion`, `mark_suggestion_built` |
| Drafts | `draft_create`, `draft_get`, `draft_update`, `draft_list`, `draft_delete`, `draft_promote` |

Agent tools: `core`'s [`tools/ops.rs`](../tools/ops.rs) adds 27 flows tools to the tool list
(`propose_workflow`, `run_flow`, the 22 builder tools, `suggest_workflows`,
`flow_memory_recall`, `flow_memory_remember`), each behind the `flows` feature.

## Boundaries

- `vendor/tinyflows` (tinyflows repo) owns the workflow model, migration,
  validation, compilation, and the run engine with its in-crate state-graph
  runtime. `tinyflows-catalog` owns the saved-flow types and registries,
  `tinyflows-sqlite` owns the schema and SQL for flows, drafts and checkpoints,
  and `tinyflows-copilot` owns the authoring manual and pure text heuristics.
  Fix engine and storage behavior there, not here.
- `cron/` owns scheduling. This domain only arms and removes `JobType::Flow`
  jobs; the scheduler publishes `DomainEvent::FlowScheduleTick`.
- [`integrations/composio/`](../integrations/composio/) owns the Composio catalog, connections and trigger
  ingestion. Flows reads them for gates, pickers and `tool_call` execution.
- `memory/` owns storage. Flows only tags items.
- The approval gate (`approval::gate`) decides when a node parks. The approval
  manifest mirrors that logic and never re-implements it.
- The skill catalogue types (`Workflow`, `WorkflowScope`) and `BundledSkill`
  belong to `skills/`.
- Webhook-triggered dispatch is not implemented in this domain.

## Gotchas

- The family is gated as a leaf, not a facade. `pub mod flows;` in `lib.rs` sits
  behind `#[cfg(feature = "flows")]` and there is no `stub.rs`. Every outside
  reference is a registration site (`core::all`, the subscribers in
  `core::runtime::subscribers`, the boot sweeps in `core::runtime::services`,
  the tool list in `tools::ops`, the `BUILTINS` entries, the catalogue extension
  in [`agent/session_host/builder/factory.rs`](../agent/session_host/builder/factory.rs)), and a registration site wants
  absence when the feature is off. A stub would make `flows.*` a known method
  that fails at runtime. If an always-compiled domain ever gains a real `use
  crate::flows::...`, convert to the facade-plus-stub shape used by `voice/`.
- Register the cancel token before the run id becomes observable. Both run
  entry points do this; moving registration into the spawned task reopens a race
  where a cancel writes `cancelled` while the run still fires its side effects.
- `flows_resume` must keep its pending-node check. The engine does not enforce
  the `approvals` argument.
- `kv_get`, `kv_set` and `upsert_flow_run_step` are public only so the seam
  (`SqliteStateStore`, `FlowRunObserver`) can reach the store from the sibling
  `tinyflows` module.

## Tests

Tests sit beside their modules as `*_tests.rs` files ([`ops_tests.rs`](./ops_tests.rs),
[`bus_tests.rs`](./bus_tests.rs), [`schemas_tests.rs`](./schemas_tests.rs), the builder tool and agent prompt tests,
and the seam's own suite under `tinyflows/`). `store.rs` has no test
attachment; the store's behavior is covered in `tinyflows-sqlite`.

```bash
cargo test -p openhuman flows::
pnpm debug rust flows
```
