# inference

The inference domain turns OpenHuman configuration into working language models. Given a workload
name such as `chat` or `reasoning`, it decides which provider serves it (the managed OpenHuman
backend, a bring-your-own-key cloud provider, a local runtime the user runs, or a CLI subprocess),
builds a native `ChatModel`, and applies product policy around it: credentials, Privacy Mode, error
copy, Sentry demotion, and context-window sizing. It also owns the `inference.*`, `embeddings.*`
and `tokenjuice.*` RPC surfaces and the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` HTTP endpoint.

Reusable model, provider-transport, embedding, capability, temperature and failure-classification
code lives in the vendored `tinyinference` crates. The agent loop and model-call retries live in
`tinyagents`. This folder is the product layer over both. The agent harness, voice, memory, web
chat, flows, scheduling and channels all call into it.

## How it works

### Resolving a workload to a model

Every caller starts with a role (`chat`, `reasoning`, `agentic`, `coding`, `vision`, `memory`,
`embeddings`, `learning`, and so on) or a model hint like `hint:reasoning`. The factory in
[`provider/factory.rs`](./provider/factory.rs) resolves that in three steps.

```text
  caller (agent turn, memory summarizer, flows node, RPC prompt)
     |
     |  role or hint:*         e.g. "reasoning", "hint:coding"
     v
  routing.rs / tiers.rs     role -> provider string from config
     |                        (chat_provider, reasoning_provider, ...)
     |  provider string       e.g. "openhuman", "ollama:qwen3@0.2"
     v
  access_gates.rs           Privacy Mode LocalOnly check, session check,
     |                        egress descriptor
     v
  constructor by prefix:
     +-- managed_backend.rs       "openhuman" / "cloud" -> OpenHumanBackendModel
     +-- local_runtime.rs         ollama / lmstudio / mlx / local-openai
     +-- cloud_slug.rs            "<slug>:<model>" BYOK, OpenAI or Anthropic wire
     +-- subprocess_providers.rs  claude_agent_sdk:, claude-code:
     v
  (Arc<dyn ChatModel<()>>, resolved model id)
```

The provider-string grammar is documented at the top of `provider/factory.rs`:

```text
"openhuman"                     managed backend, model = config.default_model
"cloud" / empty                 primary_cloud (legacy inference_url wins while
                                primary still points at OpenHuman)
"ollama:<model>[@<temp>]"       local Ollama at config.local_ai.base_url
"lmstudio:<model>[@<temp>]"     local LM Studio
"mlx:<model>[@<temp>]"          local MLX-compatible server
"local-openai:<model>[@<temp>]" any local OpenAI-compatible server
"<slug>:<model>[@<temp>]"       cloud_providers entry keyed by slug
"claude_agent_sdk:<model>"      Claude Agent SDK subprocess
"claude-code:<model>"           Claude Code CLI subprocess
```

The optional `@<temp>` suffix pins a temperature for that workload. It is stripped
(`routing::split_model_and_temperature`) before the model id goes upstream. Unknown slugs and
missing credentials produce actionable errors instead of a silent fallback.

Background roles (`vision`, `embeddings`, `memory`, `agentic`, `burst`) fall back to the primary
cloud provider when their own route is unset, because they run tier models that local runtimes and
most BYOK slugs do not serve. [`provider/fallback_diagnostics.rs`](./provider/fallback_diagnostics.rs) exists so that when this fallback
lands on a provider with no credentials, the error says it was a background role that fell back,
instead of naming a slug the user never configured.

Hints and retired tier slugs never reach the managed backend verbatim. `tiers.rs` maps them to a
role (`role_for_model_tier`) or to the concrete managed default (`resolve_model_for_hint`), while
raw catalog ids a user pins on an agent (for example `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`) pass
through unchanged (`is_raw_passthrough_model`). The TinyAgents workload router that consumes this
for agent turns is in [`agent/tinyagents/routes.rs`](../agent/tinyagents/routes.rs).

There are two families of entry points. `create_chat_model*` in `factory/chat_model.rs` is for
one-shot callers (summaries, sentiment, prompts). `create_turn_chat_model*` in
`factory/turn_model.rs` is for agent turns and carries native-tool and route options. Both go
through the same gates and constructors.

### The managed backend model

[`provider/openhuman_backend_model.rs`](./provider/openhuman_backend_model.rs) is a host `ChatModel` for the OpenHuman backend. It cannot be
a plain `tinyinference` OpenAI preset for three reasons: the session bearer is resolved fresh per
call, the request carries a top-level `thread_id` so the backend can group logs and align cache
keys, and the response carries an `openhuman.{billing,usage}` envelope with the charged USD that
the generic parser drops. The model re-projects that envelope
(`openhuman_backend_model_usage.rs`) so usage meters see real costs. When the bearer's `exp` has
already passed, or the backend rejects it, it publishes `DomainEvent::SessionExpired`.

[`provider/openai_codex.rs`](./provider/openai_codex.rs) is related but is not a model. When ChatGPT/Codex OAuth tokens exist
for the `openai` slug, `resolve_openai_codex_routing` re-targets that slug at the Codex backend
with the account and originator headers. The OAuth flow itself (start, complete, import from the
Codex CLI, status, disconnect) and its token store live in [`security/credentials/openai_oauth/`](../security/credentials/openai_oauth/);
this domain only exposes the RPC wrappers in [`ops.rs`](./ops.rs).

### Local runtimes

The local runtime (Ollama, LM Studio, MLX, OMLX, any OpenAI-compatible server) is installed,
started and stocked with models by the user. OpenHuman never downloads a model, never launches or
stops the runtime, never installs Piper, and does not pick models by RAM tier. It probes the
configured endpoint (`ready`, `degraded`, `unreachable`), reports which configured models are
served, enforces a minimum context window, and points the user at `ollama pull <model>` when a
model is missing.

`tinyinference_local` does the endpoint work. `host_runtime/` keeps the product side:

```text
  config.local_ai  --local_runtime_config()-->  tinyinference_local::RuntimeConfig
                                                         |
  host_runtime::global(config)  ---- OnceCell ---->  LocalAiService (probe state)
         |
         +-- ops/runtime_ops.rs   status, summarize, prompt, vision, transcribe, tts
         +-- ops/agent_chat.rs    agent_chat, agent_chat_simple, agent_chat_for
         +-- ops/turn_guards.rs   prompt-injection gate, cwd grant, turn origin
         +-- service/speech.rs    transcribe / tts bindings used by crate::voice
```

`LocalAiService` is a process-lifetime singleton holding the last probe verdict.
`inference.update_local_settings` resets it so the next status poll re-probes. Local STT through
whisper.cpp is retired; speech-to-text goes through the engine configured in
`voice_server.stt_engine` (see [`config/migrations/retire_local_whisper_stt.rs`](../config/migrations/retire_local_whisper_stt.rs)), and the speech
bindings call `crate::voice::create_stt_provider` for it. Local TTS uses a Piper binary the user
installed (`PIPER_BIN` or `PATH`).

`agent_chat_for` in [`host_runtime/ops/agent_chat.rs`](./host_runtime/ops/agent_chat.rs) is the native agent-turn entry used by
`openhuman-rpc` and `openhuman-embed`. It runs the turn under the agent's own `CoreContext`,
resumes the thread's session with `ResumeMode::Session`, and is boxed on purpose so other crates
do not each instantiate its state machine.

### Context windows

The context window drives pre-dispatch trimming and the compaction trigger, so [`context_window.rs`](./context_window.rs)
resolves it per turn in this order:

```text
  1. config override       model_registry[].context_window (non-zero)
  2. provider-reported     tinyinference_llm::model::discover, cached per
                           endpoint+model, lowered by any limit learned from
                           a context-overflow error on that endpoint
  3. local profile         for local runtimes
  4. static guess          model_context::static_context_window_for_model,
                           logged at warn once per model
```

The discovery request comes from [`provider/factory/discovery.rs`](./provider/factory/discovery.rs) (`model_limits_request`), built
from the same endpoint and credential resolution the chat factory uses. The resolved value is
remembered, so the synchronous `context_window_for_model` (usage meters, the context breakdown)
reports the same number the turn used. [`model_context.rs`](./model_context.rs) also answers vision capability through
`model_supports_vision` and the user's `model_registry` `vision` flag.

### Failures

A failed provider call passes through several layers, each with one job:

```text
  HTTP / transport error
     |
     v
  provider/ops/http_error/dispatch.rs   api_error(): run every classifier
     |  quota_and_credits, local_provider, policy_rejection,
     |  context_window, auth_failure
     |
     +--> auth_failure.rs: 401 from managed backend -> SessionExpired event
     |                     401/403 on a BYO key -> auth_error_registry::record
     |                        -> ProviderApiKeyRejected (once per episode)
     v
  provider/error_code.rs     managed errorCode present? backend owns Sentry
  provider/error_classify.rs rate-limit / upstream-unhealthy / retry-after
     v
  failure_copy/table.rs      class -> error_type, source, retryable, copy
                             (consumed by web_chat::web_errors)
```

Provider-text matching itself (including the budget-phrase matcher) is upstream in
`tinyinference`. [`auth_error_registry.rs`](./auth_error_registry.rs) is the single record of rejected BYO keys: the
notification center gets one event per failure episode, and the AI settings page reads the live
list through `inference.provider_auth_errors`. Entries clear when the user updates or removes the
key in the credentials domain. [`failure_copy/halt.rs`](./failure_copy/halt.rs) holds the summaries the loop guards record
when they stop a turn for repeated tool failures.

### The OpenAI-compatible endpoint

`http/server.rs` serves `/v1/chat/completions` (with SSE streaming) and `/v1/models`.
`openhuman-rpc` mounts it with `.nest("/v1", openhuman_core::inference::http::router())`, so it sits
behind the same bearer middleware as `/rpc`. The bearer may be either the per-launch core token or
a stable user-managed key stored under the `EXTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPAT_PROVIDER` auth profile, which
lets external harnesses use OpenHuman as an OpenAI-compatible router. The request's `model` field
picks the provider the same way a provider string does.

## Layout

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`mod.rs`](./mod.rs) | Module declarations and re-exports. Also `local_runtime_config` (projects `config.local_ai` into TinyInference's input), `local_vision_mode`, `disabled_local_ai_status`, the `LocalModelConfig` impl for `Config`, and `INFERENCE_COMPILED_IN`. |
| `ops.rs` | `inference_*` business operations returning `Outcome<T>`: status, prompt, summarize, vision, sentiment, provider tests, model listing, settings updates, OpenAI OAuth wrappers, diagnostics. Demotes expected user-config failures to `warn!`. |
| [`schemas.rs`](./schemas.rs), `schemas/` | The `inference.*` controller registry. `catalog.rs` has the schemas; `prompt_handlers.rs`, `settings_handlers.rs`, `oauth_handlers.rs` and `claude_code_handlers.rs` hold the thin handlers. |
| `context_window.rs` | Per-turn context-window resolution (override, provider, local profile, static guess). |
| `model_context.rs` | Static context-window table, the remembered window lookup, and vision capability checks. |
| `auth_error_registry.rs` | Process-lived registry of rejected BYO provider keys, with a once-per-episode latch. |
| `failure_copy/` | `table.rs` maps a failure class to the wire `error_type`, source, retry verdict and user copy. `halt.rs` has loop-guard halt summaries. |
| `provider/` | Model construction and provider policy. See [`provider/README.md`](provider/README.md). |
| `provider/factory.rs`, [`provider/factory/`](./provider/factory/) | Provider-string grammar and model construction: `routing`, `tiers`, `primary_cloud`, `access_gates`, `credentials`, `managed_backend`, `local_runtime`, `cloud_slug`, `subprocess_providers`, `discovery`, `chat_model`, `turn_model`. |
| `provider/openhuman_backend_model*.rs` | Managed backend `ChatModel`, its call path and its usage/billing projection. |
| `provider/openai_codex.rs` | Codex routing metadata for the `openai` slug when Codex OAuth is connected. |
| [`provider/error_code.rs`](./provider/error_code.rs), [`provider/error_classify.rs`](./provider/error_classify.rs) | Managed `errorCode` extraction and Sentry ownership; OpenHuman policy over TinyInference's classifier. |
| `provider/fallback_diagnostics.rs` | Explains background-role fallback when it hits a provider with no credentials. |
| [`provider/ops/`](./provider/ops/) | `http_error/` (classification and `api_error`), `models/` (model catalog listing, local-runtime and OpenRouter entries), `provider_factory.rs` (`ProviderRuntimeOptions`, `list_providers`). |
| [`provider/types.rs`](./provider/types.rs) | Host DTOs kept at product and RPC boundaries: `ChatResponse`, `ProviderDelta`, `BilledUsage`, `AGENT_TURN_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`. |
| `host_runtime/` | Product policy, RPC and speech bindings over `tinyinference_local`. See [`host_runtime/README.md`](host_runtime/README.md). |
| `embedding_host/` | Embedding provider selection (managed, Voyage, OpenAI, Cohere, Ollama, custom, noop) and the `embeddings.*` RPC. See [`embedding_host/README.md`](embedding_host/README.md). |
| `tokenjuice/` | Host adapter for the TinyJuice tool-output compression module, the `juice_retrieve` recovery tool, and the `tokenjuice.*` RPC. See [`tokenjuice/README.md`](tokenjuice/README.md). |
| `http/` | OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint. `server.rs` (router and handlers) is behind the `http-server` feature; `types.rs` and `EXTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPAT_PROVIDER` stay ungated because `core::auth` reads them. |

## Key types and entry points

- `create_chat_model`, `create_chat_model_with_model_id`, `create_chat_model_from_string` (in
  [`provider/factory/chat_model.rs`](./provider/factory/chat_model.rs)) build a model for one-shot work from a role or an explicit
  provider string.
- `create_turn_chat_model*` ([`provider/factory/turn_model.rs`](./provider/factory/turn_model.rs), crate-private) build the model for
  an agent turn.
- `provider_for_role` ([`provider/factory/routing.rs`](./provider/factory/routing.rs)) returns the configured provider string for a
  role. `resolve_model_for_hint` and `role_for_model_tier` ([`provider/factory/tiers.rs`](./provider/factory/tiers.rs)) handle
  `hint:*` markers.
- `probe_inference_readiness` (`provider/factory/chat_model.rs`) checks that a role can actually
  run: it builds the model and, for the managed backend, makes one cheap completion.
- `BYOK_INCOMPLETE_SENTINEL` (`provider/factory.rs`) marks a BYOK route with missing pieces.
- `OpenHumanBackendModel` (`provider/openhuman_backend_model.rs`) is the managed backend model.
- `host_runtime::global` ([`host_runtime/core.rs`](./host_runtime/core.rs)) returns the `LocalAiService` singleton.
- `agent_chat_for` and `agent_chat_reply_for` (`host_runtime/ops/agent_chat.rs`) run an agent turn
  natively. `INFERENCE_AGENT_CHAT` (`schemas.rs`) is the wire method name hosts reference.
- `context_window_for_model` (`model_context.rs`) and `resolve_context_window`
  (`context_window.rs`) answer window sizes.
- `api_error` ([`provider/ops/http_error/dispatch.rs`](./provider/ops/http_error/dispatch.rs)) is the single entry for turning a failed
  provider response into a classified error.
- `auth_error_registry::{record, clear, snapshot}` track rejected BYO keys.
- `test_provider_override` (`provider/factory.rs`) injects a mock `ChatModel` process-wide. It
  exists only under `cfg(test)` or the `e2e-test-support` / `rss-bench` features.

## RPC / CLI surface

All controllers are pushed into the registry in [`core/all.rs`](../core/all.rs) under `DomainGroup::Inference`.

`inference.*` from `schemas.rs`:

- Models and routing: `resolve_model`, `list_models`, `test_provider_model`.
- Status and settings: `status`, `get_client_config`, `update_model_settings`,
  `update_local_settings`, `diagnostics`, `provider_auth_errors`.
- One-shot inference: `summarize`, `prompt`, `vision_prompt`, `analyze_sentiment`.
- OpenAI/Codex OAuth: `openai_oauth_start`, `openai_oauth_complete`,
  `openai_oauth_import_codex_cli`, `openai_oauth_status`, `openai_oauth_disconnect`.
- Claude Code: `claude_code_status`, `claude_code_auth_status`, `claude_code_settings`,
  `claude_code_set_full_access`.

`inference.*` from [`host_runtime/schemas.rs`](./host_runtime/schemas.rs): `agent_chat`, `agent_chat_simple`, `transcribe`,
`transcribe_bytes`, `tts`, `test_connection`.

`embeddings.*` from [`embedding_host/schemas.rs`](./embedding_host/schemas.rs): `get_settings`, `update_settings`, `set_api_key`,
`clear_api_key`, `embed`, `test_connection`.

`tokenjuice.*` from [`tokenjuice/schemas.rs`](./tokenjuice/schemas.rs): `detect`, `compress`, `cache_stats`, `retrieve`,
`settings_get`, `settings_update`, `savings_stats`, `savings_reset`.

Legacy names such as `openhuman.local_ai_*`, `openhuman.update_local_ai_settings` and
`openhuman.providers_list_models` are rewritten to the canonical methods by
[`core/legacy_aliases.rs`](../core/legacy_aliases.rs) (and [`app/src/services/rpcMethods.ts`](../../../../app/src/services/rpcMethods.ts) on the frontend). The download,
asset-status, Piper-installer, preset and device-profile controllers no longer exist.

Outside JSON-RPC, `http::router()` serves `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models`.

## Events and persistence

This domain publishes but does not subscribe; there is no `bus.rs`. `SessionExpired` comes from
[`provider/ops/http_error/auth_failure.rs`](./provider/ops/http_error/auth_failure.rs) and `provider/openhuman_backend_model.rs`.
`ProviderApiKeyRejected` comes from `auth_failure.rs`, gated by `auth_error_registry`.

There is no `store.rs`. Routing, provider and local settings persist through `config` (`config/ops/
model.rs` and friends). Provider keys live in the encrypted auth-profile store under
`provider:<slug>` ([`provider/factory/credentials.rs`](./provider/factory/credentials.rs) also tries the legacy bare `<slug>`). The
built-in BYOK presets behind Connections, API keys, LLM are in [`config/schema/cloud_providers.rs`](../config/schema/cloud_providers.rs).
OpenHuman stores no model artifacts.

## Boundaries

- `tinyinference` (vendored at [`vendor/tinyagents/vendor/tinyinference`](../../../../vendor/tinyagents/vendor/tinyinference/)) owns provider wire
  clients, model capability hints, temperature rules, provider-neutral error classification,
  endpoint probing for local runtimes, effective model-id resolution, and embedding providers.
  Fix provider-transport bugs there.
- `tinyagents` owns the agent loop, model-call retries and the Claude Agent SDK and Claude Code
  providers (`tinyagents_harness::providers::{claude_agent_sdk, claude_code}`). This domain only
  supplies routing and the MCP endpoint for Claude Code.
- `tinyjuice` owns compression; `tokenjuice/` is only the host adapter.
- OpenAI OAuth flow and token storage belong to `security/credentials/openai_oauth/`.
- Privacy Mode policy and egress descriptors come from `security::live_policy` and
  `security::egress`; the factory only enforces them at `access_gates.rs`.
- Voice capture, dictation and the STT engine choice belong to `crate::voice`.
- Error classification ladders for chat replies live in `web_chat::web_errors`; this domain owns
  only the copy table.

## Gotchas

- `update_model_settings` drops reserved cloud-provider slugs (the `openhuman`/`cloud` built-ins
  the frontend echoes back), and `config::ops::model::apply_model_settings` re-injects them from
  stored config so they are not lost.
- `inference.diagnostics` returns its payload without the `{result, logs}` envelope, matching the
  legacy `local_ai_diagnostics` shape that `json_rpc_e2e` asserts on.
- `ops.rs` logs known provider and user-config failures (unknown provider, 401, 429,
  model-not-found) at `warn!` to keep them out of Sentry. Only unclassified failures reach
  `error!`.
- A managed response carrying an `errorCode` is owned by the backend for Sentry purposes; the core
  must not double-report it, except for a backend-flagged malformed `BAD_REQUEST`.
- `test_provider_override` is process-global. Tests that install it must run serially and drop the
  guard.
- `http::router()` only exists with the `http-server` feature. `INFERENCE_COMPILED_IN` reports
  whether the `inference` feature (and the `cpal` audio stack) was compiled in.
- There is no local-runtime shutdown step because OpenHuman never spawns one.

## Tests

Tests sit beside their modules as `<module>_tests.rs` (for example [`ops_tests.rs`](./ops_tests.rs),
[`context_window_tests.rs`](./context_window_tests.rs), [`provider/factory_tests.rs`](./provider/factory_tests.rs)). Tests that touch the runtime singleton or
shared config take `inference_test_guard()` / `inference_test_guard_async()` from
[`host_runtime/mod.rs`](./host_runtime/mod.rs). Run them with `cargo test -p openhuman inference::` or
`pnpm debug rust inference`. JSON-RPC behavior is covered in [`tests/json_rpc_e2e.rs`](../../../../tests/json_rpc_e2e.rs).
