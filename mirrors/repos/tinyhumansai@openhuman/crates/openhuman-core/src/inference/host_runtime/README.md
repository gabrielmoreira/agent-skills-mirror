# host_runtime

OpenHuman-owned bindings around `tinyinference-local`.

The reusable runtime implementation lives in the `tinyinference-local` crate:
endpoint resolution and probing for Ollama / LM Studio / MLX / OMLX /
OpenAI-compatible runtimes, status, prompts, vision, and embeddings. The user
installs and runs that runtime and pulls its models; neither crate downloads,
installs, or spawns anything. This directory contains only OpenHuman policy
and integration seams:

- `core.rs`: process-wide service ownership.
- `ops.rs` and `ops/`: RPC operations, prompt access checks, agent dispatch,
  scheduler-gate acquisition, and temporary-file handling.
- `schemas.rs`: OpenHuman controller registration and wire compatibility.
- `service/speech.rs`: OpenHuman STT credential routing and Piper output.
- `service/transcription.rs`: channel-facing transcription adapter shape.

Code here must call TinyInference directly. Do not copy local-runtime behavior
back into this host module.
