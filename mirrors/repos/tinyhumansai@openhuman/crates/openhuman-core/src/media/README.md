# media

Family root for media agent tools. Today it has one member,
[`generation`](generation/README.md), which gives the agent image and video
generation through OpenRouter, proxied by the TinyHumans backend. The family
is tools-only: there is no RPC controller, no store, and no bus subscriber.
The tool registry in `tools/ops.rs` is the only caller.

## How it works

The work is split across three owners. This crate holds only the host policy.

```text
 tools/ops.rs  (#[cfg(feature = "media")], DomainSet::media)
     |
     v
 media::generation::build_media_tools(config, action_dir)
     |
     |-- provider::managed_generators(config)
     |     BackendClient: raw_client(), url_for(OPENROUTER_PROXY_PATH)
     |       (OPENROUTER_PROXY_PATH = "/agent-integrations/openrouter")
     |     no backend transport installed -> None -> no media tools
     |
     |     MediaGenerators { image, video }, each wrapped in a Guard:
     |       admit():  local-only enforcement, then egress disclosure
     |       budget(): refuse a billed submit when managed credits are out
     |
     v
 tinyagents_harness::media::{GenerateImageTool, GenerateVideoTool}
     renamed media_generate_image / media_generate_video
     wrapped in MediaArtifactTool (files each output as an artifact)
   + MediaListModelsTool (media_list_models)
     |
     v
 tinyinference-image / tinyinference-video
     OpenRouter wire contract, submit -> poll -> download job loop
```

When the agent calls `media_generate_image`, the TinyAgents tool parses the
arguments and calls the guarded generator. The guard checks the privacy
policy and announces the external transfer, checks the managed-credit budget,
then hands the request to TinyInference, which talks to OpenRouter through the
backend proxy. The image is written under `<action_dir>/generated-media/`.
`MediaArtifactTool` then moves each saved file into the visible files folder,
records it as an artifact (metadata under the workspace's `artifacts/<id>/`),
and adds an `artifact_id` to that file's entry in the result so the chat UI
can show a card. Video works the same way, except the generator submits a job
and polls it (every 5 s, for up to 600 s) before downloading the clip. A
timed-out video can be resumed with `resume_job_id` instead of paying for a
new job.

The credential is resolved per request through `resolve_backend_credential`,
so a desktop session JWT and a library API key both work, and a refreshed
session is picked up mid-run. Billing and margin stay on the backend; this
module never charges, it only refuses to submit when
`integrations::client::budget_gate::managed_tool_budget_exhausted` says the
account is out of managed credits.

## Layout

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`mod.rs`](./mod.rs) | Declares [`generation`](./generation). |
| [`generation/`](generation/README.md) | The three `media_*` tools, the guarded OpenRouter generators, the local-reference policy, and the artifact wrapper. |

Inside `generation/`:

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `provider.rs` | `managed_generators`, `MediaGenerators`, `OPENROUTER_PROXY_PATH`, the per-request bearer resolver, and the `Guard` that wraps both generators. |
| `tools.rs` | `build_media_tools`, `media_tools_from` (the same assembly over any generators, used by tests), `reference_policy`, `MediaListModelsTool`, and the tool-name constants. |
| `artifact_tool.rs` | `MediaArtifactTool<T>`: runs the inner tool unchanged, then files every reported output as an artifact, or annotates that one entry with `artifact_error` on failure. |

## Key types and entry points

- `build_media_tools(&Config, &Path)` ([`generation/tools.rs`](./generation/tools.rs)) is the registry
  entry point. It returns an empty list, not an error, when no backend is
  reachable.
- `managed_generators(&Config)` ([`generation/provider.rs`](./generation/provider.rs)) builds
  `MediaGenerators { image, video }` against the backend proxy.
- `MediaArtifactTool` ([`generation/artifact_tool.rs`](./generation/artifact_tool.rs)) is the artifact-tracking
  wrapper, following the same `create_artifact_for_call` /
  `finalize_artifact` / `fail_artifact` pattern the document and presentation
  tools use.
- `IMAGE_TOOL_NAME`, `VIDEO_TOOL_NAME`, `LIST_MODELS_TOOL_NAME` pin the names
  the `media` tool pack and agent allowlists depend on.

## Agent tools

| Tool | Permission | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `media_generate_image` | Execute | Generates or edits images from a prompt, optionally with reference images (URLs or workspace paths). Billed per call. |
| `media_generate_video` | Execute | Generates a short clip, optionally from a first or last frame. Blocks until ready. Billed per call. |
| `media_list_models` | ReadOnly | Lists image and/or video models with an optional substring filter. |

## Boundaries

- The OpenRouter wire contract, reference and output-shape standards, and the
  job loop belong to TinyInference (`tinyinference-image`,
  `tinyinference-video`, in `vendor/tinyagents/vendor/tinyinference`, upstream
  `tinyhumansai/tinyinference`), reached through `tinyagents_harness`.
- Argument parsing, writing files into the workspace, and result wording
  belong to TinyAgents (`tinyagents_harness::media`, in `vendor/tinyagents`).
- Provider keys, billing, and the proxy route belong to the backend.
- Artifact storage belongs to `agent::artifacts`.

## Gotchas

- Two gates. The `media` Cargo feature (in the core's default set, listed in
  `scripts/ci/product-features.txt`, forwarded from
  `crates/openhuman-app/Cargo.toml`) decides whether `openhuman::media`
  compiles. It turns on `tinyagents-harness/media`. At runtime,
  `DomainSet::media` in `core/runtime/builder.rs` filters any tool whose name
  starts with `media_` (`tool_group()` in `tools/ops.rs`). Nothing else is
  tagged `DomainGroup::Media`.
- Local reference files are limited by `reference_policy` to the action
  directory or workspace, with no `..` and nothing under an always-forbidden
  path (credential stores, system roots). Anything else must be an https URL.
- A core with no backend transport installed (a library host with no
  TinyHumans connection) has no media tools at all, rather than broken ones.

## Tests

[`generation/tools_tests.rs`](./generation/tools_tests.rs) (tool schemas, reference policy, flows over mock
generators) and [`generation/artifact_tool_tests.rs`](./generation/artifact_tool_tests.rs) (artifact filing and
per-entry failure).

```bash
cargo test -p openhuman media::
```
