## src-tauri-web

This sibling to [`src-tauri-mobile/`](../src-tauri-mobile/icons/README.md) is the browser-hosted shell profile for
OpenHuman E2E and future web-compatible development.

Scope:

- No CEF runtime (the desktop shell now runs on Wry, see [Tauri shell](../../gitbooks/developing/architecture/tauri-shell.md))
- No embedded provider webviews
- No native windowing, tray, or deep-link plugins
- Frontend talks to a standalone [`openhuman-core`](../../crates/openhuman-cli/README.md) over HTTP JSON-RPC

Current entrypoints:

- `pnpm build:web:e2e` builds the browser bundle into `app/dist-web`
- `pnpm test:e2e:web` (see [E2E testing](../../gitbooks/developing/e2e-testing.md)) starts the mock backend ([`scripts/mock-api-server.mjs`](../../scripts/mock-api-server.mjs)), standalone core, and static web
  host, then runs Playwright against the browser build
- `pnpm test:e2e:mega` keeps the CEF/Appium mega-flow on the desktop shell

This folder is intentionally documentation-first for now. The browser shell is
composed from the existing Vite app plus the standalone core runner rather than
another Tauri crate.
