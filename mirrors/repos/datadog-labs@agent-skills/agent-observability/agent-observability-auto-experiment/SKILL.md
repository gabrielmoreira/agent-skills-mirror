  Run an iterative code-improvement hill-climb against real Datadog LLM-Obs data, locally, with
  Claude Code as the agent. Establishes a baseline eval, makes one focused change, re-scores with
  the same harness, keeps the change only if it beats the best, and repeats. Use when the user
  says "run an auto experiment", "hill-climb this code", "iteratively improve X and measure the
  delta", "optimize this prompt/file against my traces", "auto-optimize against LLM-Obs", or wants
  the local equivalent of the auto_experiments worker. Works from an ml_app, a dataset_id, or a
  list of trace_ids.

# auto-experiment — local hill-climb improvement loop

This is the local, Claude-Code-driven version of the `auto_experiments` Temporal/Atlas worker
(`domains/ml_observability/apps/apis/auto_experiments/`). There, a remote Bits/Code-Gen agent runs
the loop; **here YOU (Claude Code) are the agent** and run it directly on the current git checkout.
No Temporal, no Code-Gen API — just git commits, a local eval harness, and Datadog LLM-Obs MCP
tools for the data.

**Read `references/rubrics.md` in full before iteration 1 and keep it in mind every iteration.**
It holds the non-negotiable rules (never invent a score; what to score; where the data lives; the
harness spec; the metric schema). This file is the control loop; that file is the law.

## Inputs (the experiment config)

Repo = current working directory. **Fields marked _must ask_ are mandatory — never proceed with a
silent default; collect them from the user.** Fields marked _default_ may be filled without asking,
but **every field (must-ask and default alike) must be shown to the user and validated before the
run starts** (see the Mandatory intake gate below).

| Field | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `files_to_optimize` | the **edit scope**: one or more files, a **folder**, or globs. **Any code inside the scope is fair game to modify** — tool/retrieval code, the pipeline, config, data-shaping, or prompts — not just prompt wording. Everything outside the scope is off-limits. | **must ask** |
| `goal` | what "better" means; the judge rubric + optimization direction | **must ask** |
| `evaluators` | explicit evaluator/rubric text — how each datapoint is scored (ground-truth check vs LLM-judge, pass criteria, direction). | **must ask** (do NOT silently fall back to `goal`) |
| data source | where the eval data comes from — **either** a `dataset_id` **or** an `ml_app` to pull traces from (optionally narrowed by explicit `trace_ids`). | **must ask** — mandatory; the run cannot start without one of `dataset_id` / `ml_app` (priority below) |
| `max_iterations` | how many changes to try (clamp **1–50**) | _default_ **2** |
| `model` | judge model id | _default_: the Claude model selected in this session (see rubric) |
| `base_branch` | branch the baseline is measured on | _default_: current branch / `main` |

`runs` and `min_delta` are **not inputs** — they are **derived** from the measured baseline noise in
Step 2.4, not chosen by anyone. Do **not** ask for them and do **not** show them in the all-params
validation. They are computed during the run and displayed once, at the end, with their reasoning.

### Mandatory intake gate — do this FIRST, before Setup

Before writing any config or touching git:

1. Collect every **must-ask** field from an explicit user answer. If any is missing, ask for it — do
   **not** default, infer, or guess:
   - **`files_to_optimize`** — the user names the concrete file(s)/folder/globs. Never assume the
     scope from context. Resolve a folder/glob to the concrete editable file list.
   - **`goal`** — the optimization target + direction.
   - **`evaluators`** — how a datapoint is scored (pass/fail, metric, direction). Do not reuse
     `goal` as the evaluator. **Use the user's evaluator text verbatim. NEVER invent, extend,
     narrow, or change the metric or direction of an evaluator** — do not turn "recall" into "F1",
     do not add a precision term the user didn't ask for, do not flip the direction. If `goal` and
     the user's `evaluators` appear to disagree (e.g. `goal` says "balanced precision and recall"
     but the stated evaluator is recall-only), **STOP and ask the user which one governs** — do
     **not** silently reconcile them by rewriting the rubric. The metric the harness optimizes must
     be the one the user approved, or every keep/discard decision optimizes the wrong objective.
   - **data source** — **mandatory**: the user must provide **either** a `dataset_id` **or** an
     `ml_app` to find traces from (optionally narrowed by explicit `trace_ids`). Do not auto-pick,
     do not guess an `ml_app`, and do not start the run with neither — if both are missing, ask.

   **A detailed, specific goal is NOT permission to infer any must-ask field.** A rich goal is the
   single most common cause of wrongly auto-filling `files_to_optimize`, `evaluators`, and the data
   source — the more the goal spells out (a filename, a metric, a dataset), the *harder* you must
   resist reading those as answers. A goal that mentions `v12.md` is not the user choosing
   `files_to_optimize`; a goal that says "balanced precision and recall" is not the user handing you
   an evaluator; a goal that names a dataset is not the user selecting the data source. **Ask
   anyway, for every must-ask field, every time — even when you are confident you could guess it.**
   This gate is a hard STOP: if any must-ask field lacks an explicit user answer, do not write
   `config.json`, do not create the scratch branch, do not run the harness — ask (use
   `AskUserQuestion`) and wait.
2. Fill the **default** fields (`max_iterations`, `model`, `base_branch`) with their defaults above.
   Do **not** touch `runs`/`min_delta` here — they are derived in Step 2.4, not intake params.
3. **Show ALL parameters back to the user — must-ask and defaulted alike — and get explicit
   validation before starting the run.** Present the full resolved config (including the concrete
   expanded `files_to_optimize` list and each default value) and let the user confirm or override
   any field. Do **not** show `runs`/`min_delta` here (they aren't chosen yet). Show the
   `evaluators` text **exactly as the user gave it**; if you believe it needs any change, present
   the change as an explicit *proposal* ("you said recall-only; your goal mentions precision too —
   score recall-only, or switch to F1?") and record only what the user picks. Never persist an
   evaluator the user did not approve verbatim. Only after the user validates do you write
   `config.json` and proceed to Setup.

Persist the config to `.auto_experiment/config.json` and update it as the run progresses (it is
the run's state + audit trail):

```json
{
  "repo_url": "...", "base_branch": "...", "files_to_optimize": [...],
  "goal": "...", "evaluators": "...", "ml_app": "...",
  "dataset_id": "...", "trace_ids": [...],
  "max_iterations": 2,
  "runs": null,
  "min_delta": null,
  "iteration_results": [],
  "final_result": {}
}
```

`runs` and `min_delta` start `null` — they are **computed and written in Step 2.4** from the
measured baseline noise, never chosen at intake.

## Scope — optimize the whole selected surface, not just the prompt

`files_to_optimize` is a **scope**, not a prompt pointer. It may be a set of files, a directory, or
globs — expand a directory to its editable files (e.g. every `*.py` under it) and treat **all of
them as the code under test**. Within that scope you may change **anything that moves the metric**:
retrieval/tool code, request logic, filtering, output shape, ranking, config, or prompts. Let the
**failure census** decide *which* file the lever lives in — do **not** default to rewording a
prompt. In practice the biggest wins are often in tool/retrieval code (what the model can fetch),
not prompt phrasing; a prompt-only search finds nothing when the headroom is in the tools.

**Hard scope guard:** never edit a file outside `files_to_optimize`. If the census's dominant lever
is out of scope, say so (that's a finding) — do not silently tweak in-scope-but-irrelevant files.

## Setup

1. Confirm a clean-ish working tree (stash or warn on unrelated changes). Note the starting SHA.
   If `files_to_optimize` names a folder/globs, resolve it to the concrete editable file list and
   record that list in `config.json` (it is the scope for every iteration + the restore boundary).
2. Create a scratch branch off `base_branch` for the experiment (e.g.
   `auto-experiment/<short-goal>`). All iteration commits land here; the user reviews/keeps the
   best commit at the end.
3. Write `.auto_experiment/config.json`. Add `.auto_experiment/` output files to nothing special
   — they are committed on purpose (they are the audit trail).
4. This run reports one score per iteration to the LLM-Obs experiment identified by the
   `DD_AUTO_EXPERIMENT_ID` environment variable (set in the environment before this skill is
   invoked — read it, don't ask the user). See **Report each iteration's score to LLM-Obs**.
5. **Record the run context on the experiment before iterations start.** Call
   `update_llmobs_experiment` once with `experiment_id` = `$DD_AUTO_EXPERIMENT_ID` (skip if unset)
   and `metadata` set to a JSON struct containing the repo name, the scratch branch name, and the
   model running this skill, e.g.
   `{"repo": "<repo>", "branch": "<scratch-branch>", "model": "<model>"}`. Derive `repo` from the
   git remote (`basename -s .git $(git remote get-url origin)`, or `owner/repo`), `branch` from the
   branch created in step 2, and `model` = the `provider/model-id` of the model/agent driving this
   session (e.g. `openai/gpt-4-turbo`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`). `metadata` **replaces**
   existing metadata, so include all three keys in the one call. Do this in Setup, before Step 1.
   **Verify it landed** (see gate below) — this is the step most often silently skipped, because it
   is an MCP side-effect with no local artifact, unlike the file/branch writes above.

### Setup verification gate — do this BEFORE Step 1

Setup steps 2 and 5 have **external** effects (a git branch; an MCP write to the experiment) that
leave no obvious local trace, so a loop racing to iteration 1 can skip them and nothing downstream
notices. Before starting Step 1, **explicitly verify every setup step against a concrete artifact**
and do not proceed until all pass. Re-run the missing step if any check fails; never assume a step
ran because you intended it to.

| # | step | verification (must actually run the check, not recall it) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | clean tree + start SHA | `git rev-parse HEAD` recorded in `config.json` `start_sha`; tree clean or unrelated changes stashed |
| 2 | scratch branch | `git branch --show-current` equals the scratch branch off `base_branch` |
| 3 | `config.json` written | file exists with every required field populated (incl. the resolved `files_to_optimize` list, `evaluators` verbatim, data source) |
| 4 | `DD_AUTO_EXPERIMENT_ID` | env var read; if unset, that is recorded and per-iteration reporting is knowingly skipped |
| 5 | run context on experiment | confirm the `update_llmobs_experiment` call **actually returned a success response in hand** (not merely that you intended to call it). For the us5 MCP that response is `updated_fields` containing `"metadata"` — accept that, or any non-error response acknowledging the metadata write if the tool's shape differs. The check is "the call was made and acknowledged", so do not hard-block on one exact field name; if the tool errored or was never called, re-run it. Skip only if `DD_AUTO_EXPERIMENT_ID` is unset. |

State the gate result briefly (each step ✓ with its evidence) before Step 1. This same
"external-effect step → verify against an artifact" discipline is why per-iteration score
submissions are also confirmed by the tool's `metrics_ingested` response, not assumed.

## Execution model — orchestrator + fresh per-iteration sub-agents

Split the two roles so context stays clean and iterations don't anchor on each other:

- **You are the orchestrator.** You own the durable state (`config.json`, `census.json`, `best_sha`,
  the branch), the harness, and every keep/discard decision. You do NOT accumulate the raw work of
  each attempt in your own context.
- **Each improvement iteration runs in a FRESH sub-agent** (spawn via the Agent tool). Hand it a
  compact briefing — not your whole transcript: the `goal`/`evaluators`, the full editable **scope**
  (`files_to_optimize` expanded — it may change ANY file in scope, not just a prompt), the
  ranked `census.json` buckets (+ the bucket to target this iteration), the current `best_sha`, and
  **one-line summaries of prior attempts** (what was tried → kept/discarded, from `iteration_results`)
  so it won't repeat them. Its job: make ONE change + return a short summary (what it changed, which
  bucket, feasibility-probe result). You (orchestrator) run the harness, apply the noise gate +
  mechanism audit, commit/keep/discard, and update state.
- **Why:** a fresh bounded context per iteration avoids anchoring on dead ideas and stops the
  orchestrator's context from bloating over a long run — the same reason the production loop spawns a
  new `claude --print` per iteration instead of one long-lived agent. If sub-agents are unavailable,
  emulate it: before each iteration, re-read only the briefing above and deliberately ignore the
  narrative of previous attempts beyond their one-line outcomes.

## Iteration 1 — baseline + first improvement

Mirrors `build_initial_prompt`. Four steps, in order.

### Step 1 — Load the evaluation data
Pick the data source in this priority order and materialize it to `.auto_experiment/data.jsonl`
(one scoreable datapoint per line: the input, plus expected/reference output if present):

1. **`dataset_id` present** → `get_llmobs_dataset_records` + `get_llmobs_full_dataset_records`.
2. **else non-empty `trace_ids`** → `get_llmobs_trace` (full tree), `get_llmobs_span_details`,
   `get_llmobs_span_content`.
3. **else** → fetch the last ~30 LLM traces for `ml_app` (search LLM-Obs spans), and record the
   trace IDs you used back into `config.json` `trace_ids` so later iterations reuse the SAME
   corpus.

Extract input/output per the **messages-source guidance** in `references/rubrics.md` (score the
`messages` field on the child LLM span, not the thin root `input.value`). Apply the
**data-selection guidance**: keep only traces with a scoreable target span; exclude infra/setup
spans from the set entirely.

Then **split once, deterministically** (hash of datapoint id, ~70/30) into
`.auto_experiment/data.val.jsonl` (the hill-climb gate) and `.auto_experiment/data.test.jsonl`
(held out) — see the rubric's **Held-out split**. Every iteration scores on `val`
(`AUTO_EXP_DATA=.auto_experiment/data.val.jsonl`); `test` is run only in the final report.

### Step 2 — Build the harness and compute BEFORE (baseline)
Copy `references/eval_harness_template.py` to `.auto_experiment/eval_harness.py` and fill in
`generate_output` (run the REAL code under test from `files_to_optimize`) and `judge`. **Prefer a
deterministic ground-truth metric** (reference output / programmatic checker / pipeline count) and
use an LLM-as-judge only when no ground truth exists — see the rubric's **Metric selection**. **No
score literals anywhere.**

Run it against the **original, unmodified** code with a **fixed pilot** `AUTO_EXP_RUNS` (**3** — an
internal bootstrap value, not a user param): the harness re-runs the whole eval R times and prints
`{mean, stdev, run_means, ...}`. `before_score` = the printed `mean`; also record `stdev` (the
noise floor). Both computed numbers, never literals — obey the scoring policy and the **Noise &
keep/discard policy** in the rubric. This pilot noise is what Step 2.4 turns into the real `runs`
and `min_delta`.

Commit `eval_harness.py`, `data.jsonl`, `data.val.jsonl`, `data.test.jsonl`, `eval_results.jsonl`.

**Do NOT report the baseline to LLM-Obs yet.** Step 2.4 may raise `runs` and re-run the baseline,
which **replaces** this pilot `mean`/`stdev`. Reporting the pilot now would publish an
`iteration:0` score that disagrees with the baseline the keep/discard gate actually uses. The
iteration-0 report is deferred to the end of Step 2.4, once the final derived-runs baseline exists.

### Step 2.4 — Derive `runs` and `min_delta` from the measured baseline noise
The pilot baseline (3 runs) gives a **real** noise floor (`stdev`, `run_means`). `runs` and
`min_delta` are **computed from it**, not chosen — derive both here, silently (no user prompt; they
are surfaced only in the final report, with reasoning):

- **`min_delta`** (compute first — `runs` depends on it) — set it **relative to measured noise**:
  `min_delta = max(0.02, k · baseline_stdev)` (e.g. `k ≈ 0.5`), so the floor tracks how noisy this
  metric actually is — a noisy metric gets a higher bar, a rock-steady one keeps the small floor.
- **`runs`** — the gate compares a *difference of two means*, so the noise that matters is the
  standard error of that difference: `SE_diff ≈ stdev · sqrt(2 / runs)`. For a real gain of size
  `min_delta` to be *resolvable* (clear the band at ~2·SE), you need `SE_diff ≲ min_delta / 2`,
  i.e. **`runs ≥ 8 · (baseline_stdev / min_delta)²`**. Compute that; if it exceeds the current
  `runs`, **you MUST raise `runs` to it** (clamp **2–10**) and **re-run the baseline** at the new
  `runs` (the re-run's `mean`/`stdev` replace the pilot's). This is not advisory — an underpowered
  run makes every moderate gain permanently uncallable (the classic failure: a true +0.05 that can
  never clear a 0.055 band at `runs=3`). Only if the pilot is already tight enough that the formula
  yields `≤ 3` does `runs` stay `3`. If the formula wants more than the clamp of 10, set `runs = 10`
  and **record in `config.json` that the metric is too noisy to fully resolve `min_delta` at 10
  runs** (so downstream discards of near-band candidates are known-underpowered, not confirmed
  nulls — see the **Higher-power confirmation** rule in the rubric).

Write the derived `runs` and `min_delta` into `config.json` (they started `null`) alongside the raw
baseline `stdev` + `run_means` you derived them from (audit trail). Every downstream iteration uses
these values. Do this once, here — do not recompute the gate mid-run.

**First commit the final baseline state, THEN report it to LLM-Obs as iteration 0** (deferred from
Step 2 so it reflects the final derived-runs baseline, not the pilot). If Step 2.4 raised `runs` and
re-ran the baseline, the working tree's `eval_results.jsonl` + `config.json` now hold the re-run
numbers but the commit from Step 2 still holds the pilot — **commit the updated baseline artifacts
now** (amend the Step 2 commit or add a new one) so a single commit contains the final
`eval_results.jsonl`, derived `runs`/`min_delta`, and `run_means`. Only then submit exactly one
eval-metric datapoint with `score_value` = the **final** `before_score` (the re-run mean if `runs`
was raised, else the pilot mean) and tags `["iteration:0",
"git.commit.sha:<baseline_commit_sha>", "decision:baseline"]` — the sha is the **full 40-character**
hash of that just-committed final-baseline commit (`git rev-parse HEAD`), and the score must match
the `before_score` every downstream iteration gates against. Same call shape and rules as **Report
each iteration's score to LLM-Obs**; this is the only submission with `iteration:0` and
`decision:baseline`.

### Step 2.5 — Census the baseline failures
Before changing anything, decompose **where the baseline loses** per the rubric's **Baseline
failure census**: bucket every failing datapoint by root cause, write `.auto_experiment/census.json`,
commit it, and surface the ranked buckets. This tells you which lever is worth pulling — and whether
the dominant failure mode is even reachable by editing `files_to_optimize`.

### Step 3 — Improve
Read the whole scope (`files_to_optimize`, expanded). Make **ONE focused change** toward `goal`,
aimed at the **largest census bucket you can plausibly move** (name that bucket in the iteration's
`reasoning`), **in whichever in-scope file holds the lever** — edit the tool/retrieval code if the
census says the misses are retrieval, the output/format code if they're formatting, and so on. Do
**not** default to rewording a prompt when the lever is elsewhere. Commit it on the scratch branch
with a message explaining what changed and why.

Before the (expensive) full eval, run a **feasibility probe** per the rubric's **Feasibility probe**:
the cheapest offline check that this change *could* move a failing census bucket. If the probe
reaches 0 failing datapoints, record the iteration `no_change` with the probe result and skip to the
next hypothesis — do **not** spend a full eval on a dead lever.

### Step 4 — Compute AFTER (re-run the SAME harness)
Re-run `.auto_experiment/eval_harness.py` (same `evaluate_line`, same data) against the changed
code. `after_score` = the new printed mean. Re-write `eval_results.jsonl`. Write the metric object
(schema in the rubric) to `.auto_experiment/result.json` and commit it **in the same commit** as
the change. `delta = after_score - before_score`.

Decide `is_best` per the optimization direction in `goal` **and the Noise & keep/discard policy**:
keep only if the change moves in the goal's direction AND is significant by the **two-sample
t-test** — `|t| = |after_score − before_score| / SE_diff ≥ 2` where
`SE_diff = √(after_stdev²/runs + best_stdev²/runs)` — AND `|after_score − before_score| ≥ min_delta`
(practical-effect floor). Do **not** gate on the raw-stdev band (it never shrinks with runs). If
`SE_diff == 0` (deterministic metric — both stdevs 0), the t is undefined: keep iff
`|after_score − before_score| ≥ min_delta` in the goal's direction (guard the division; see the
rubric's zero-variance case). A change that fails the t-test is `is_best: false` (discarded), not
kept. If it clears, run the
**Mechanism audit** (rubric)
— diff this iteration's `eval_results.jsonl` against the baseline's (same-count denominator; the
gain comes from datapoints the change touched) before keeping. If iteration 1 is t-test-significant
AND passes the audit, it becomes the best (`best_sha` = this commit, `best_score` = after_score). Append
the row to `config.json` `iteration_results`.

Then report this iteration's score to LLM-Obs (tag `iteration:1`) — see **Report each iteration's
score to LLM-Obs**.

## Iterations 2+ — hill climb

Mirrors `build_followup_prompt`. Baseline is already known — **do not recompute it**.

1. **Restore to the best-so-far**, so a discarded attempt cannot contaminate this one:
   - if a commit was kept → `git reset --hard <best_sha>` (stays on the scratch branch; the
     committed harness + data live in that commit, so they are preserved — do not recreate them).
   - if nothing has been kept yet → `git checkout <base_branch> -- <files_to_optimize>` (restore
     only the target files; the harness/data live only in the previous commit on this branch, so
     a hard reset to base would delete them).
2. `before_score` = the current best score (from `iteration_results`; iteration-1 baseline if
   nothing kept yet). Do NOT re-run the baseline.
3. Reuse the data from `data.jsonl` and the committed `eval_harness.py` — do not reload or rebuild.
4. Make **ONE new change, different from every previous attempt** (you can see prior attempts in
   `iteration_results`), aimed at a named `census.json` bucket, **in whichever in-scope file holds
   the lever** (tool/retrieval/pipeline/config/prompt — not prompt-only). Commit it.
5. **Feasibility probe first** (rubric): cheap offline check the change can move its target bucket;
   if it reaches 0 failing datapoints, record `no_change` and skip the full eval. Otherwise re-run
   the SAME harness on `val` → `after_score`. Re-write `eval_results.jsonl` + `result.json`, commit.
6. **Keep or discard**: keep only if the change is significant by the **two-sample t-test**
   (`|t| = |after_score − before_score| / SE_diff ≥ 2`, `SE_diff = √(after_stdev²/runs +
   best_stdev²/runs)`) AND `|after_score − before_score| ≥ min_delta`, in the goal's direction
   (if `SE_diff == 0`, decide by `|Δ| ≥ min_delta` in direction — zero-variance rule),
   **and passes the Mechanism audit** (rubric) — diff `eval_results.jsonl` vs the best commit's
   (`git show <best_sha>:.auto_experiment/eval_results.jsonl`); same denominator, gain from
   datapoints the change touched. Then → update `best_sha`/`best_score`, decision `kept`. A
   t-test-insignificant gain, a denominator artifact, or a regression → `discarded`. Append the
   row. (A borderline `discarded` here — `|t|` just under 2 — is the candidate the final
   **Higher-power confirmation** re-tests at more runs.)
7. Report this iteration's score to LLM-Obs (tag `iteration:<n>`) — see **Report each iteration's
   score to LLM-Obs**.

## Report each iteration's score to LLM-Obs (every scored iteration)

Once you have a computed score for an iteration, submit **exactly one** eval-metric datapoint to
LLM-Obs with the `submit_llmobs_experiment_events` MCP tool. Do this once per iteration, right
after the score is computed and the iteration's commit / `result.json` is written — including
iteration 1 and the **iteration-0 baseline** (reported at the end of Step 2.4; there `score_value`
= `before_score` and the decision tag is `decision:baseline`).

Call `submit_llmobs_experiment_events` with a single metric shaped exactly like this:

- `experiment_id`: the value of the `DD_AUTO_EXPERIMENT_ID` environment variable (read it from the
  environment; do not ask the user and do not invent one). If it is unset or empty, skip the
  submission and note that in the iteration `reasoning`.
- `metrics`: an array containing exactly one object with these fields and no others:
  - `label`: always the literal string `auto_experiment_score`.
  - `metric_type`: `score`.
  - `score_value`: the score this iteration produced (`after_score`) — the number computed by the
    harness, never a literal or a rounded-for-display value.
  - `timestamp_ms`: the current wall-clock time as an epoch timestamp in **milliseconds**.
  - `tags`: start with `["iteration:<n>", "git.commit.sha:<sha>", "decision:<decision>"]` and
    **also add the decision-legibility tags below**. `<n>` is this iteration's number (`1` for the
    first improvement, `2` for the next, and so on), `<sha>` is the **full 40-character** Git commit
    SHA of the commit this iteration created for its change — the complete hash from
    `git rev-parse HEAD` after committing the iteration (e.g.
    `fd0fbab7c1232e125df7b22d9df856a2ef73ab65`), **never the abbreviated 7/8-char short hash** — and
    `<decision>` is this iteration's keep/discard decision recorded in `iteration_results` (`kept` or
    `discarded`; `baseline` for iteration 0; `no_change` for an iteration whose feasibility probe or
    harness produced no measured score — see **No-change iterations** below).
  - **Decision-legibility tags (required on every scored iteration).** `score_value` alone is a
    common source of dashboard confusion: an iteration can post a **higher** `score_value` than the
    kept best and still be `discarded`, because the gate compares against the *best* (not the
    baseline) and requires statistical significance — a raw number cannot show that. Surface the
    decision's actual basis as structured, filterable tags so the "why" sits next to the score:
    - `basis:<significant|within_noise|regression|promoted|baseline|no_change>` — the one-word
      reason for the decision (`significant` = cleared the t-test and was kept; `within_noise` =
      higher/lower point estimate but not significant; `regression` = significantly worse;
      `promoted` = a within-noise candidate later confirmed at higher power).
    - `delta_vs_best:<±X.XXXX>` — the delta against the **current best** (the number the decision
      actually uses), NOT vs baseline. This is what makes "higher score, still discarded" legible.
    - `t_stat:<value>` (or `t_stat:null` when `se_diff == 0`) and `significant:<true|false>`.
  - `reasoning`: this iteration's `reasoning` string from `iteration_results`. **Lead with a
    one-line verdict** that states the decision and its basis in plain terms before the details,
    e.g. `"DISCARDED — within noise of best (Δvs_best +0.016, t=0.94); higher point estimate but not
    statistically above the best, not a regression."` Then the usual detail (what was tried, which
    census bucket, mechanism-audit result). Use the same text recorded in `result.json`; do not
    fabricate. The lead line + the tags must agree.
  - Do **not** include `span_id`, `categorical_value`, or `boolean_value`.

Example arguments for iteration 5 whose harness computed a score of `0.72`:

```json
{
  "experiment_id": "<value of $DD_AUTO_EXPERIMENT_ID>",
  "metrics": [
    {
      "label": "auto_experiment_score",
      "metric_type": "score",
      "score_value": 0.72,
      "reasoning": "KEPT — significant (Δvs_best +0.048, t=3.1). Rewrote the retrieval query builder to include entity synonyms (targeting the 'missed-retrieval' census bucket); cleared the t-test (|t|≥2) and passed the mechanism audit.",
      "timestamp_ms": 1752430000000,
      "tags": ["iteration:5", "git.commit.sha:33ec6e0959bd46b0ea9c337cf6a28a763d3eeb0a", "decision:kept", "basis:significant", "delta_vs_best:+0.0480", "t_stat:3.1", "significant:true"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- **One metric per iteration, plus at most one correction.** Submit exactly one metric per
  iteration at the time it is scored, and never batch several iterations into one call. The **only**
  second event allowed for the same iteration is a **promotion correction** (see final-report
  Higher-power confirmation): re-submitting that iteration with `decision:kept` +
  `promoted:higher_power_confirmation` after it is promoted. That correction is not a second
  measurement.
- **Consumer dedup rule (state it, honor it).** Because the store is append-only, an iteration may
  have two events (an earlier `decision:discarded` and a later promotion correction). Consumers of
  `auto_experiment_score` MUST dedupe **per `iteration:<n>` tag, keeping the event with the latest
  `timestamp_ms`** — that event carries the iteration's final decision. Equivalently: a
  `promoted:higher_power_confirmation` event supersedes any earlier decision for the same
  `iteration:<n>`. Do not average or count both.
- The value you submit is the same computed `after_score` recorded in `result.json`; the two must
  always agree — **except a `no_change` iteration**, which has no computed `after_score` and instead
  carries forward `best_score` as a `decision:no_change` marker (see **No-change iterations**).

### No-change iterations — emit a carried-forward marker, not a measurement

A `no_change` iteration (feasibility probe inconclusive, harness wouldn't run, judge unreachable, no
new commit) has **no computed score**. The event schema still requires a numeric `score_value` and a
`reasoning`, so you cannot omit them — but you must **not** invent a measurement. Emit a labeled
carry-forward instead:

- `score_value`: the **current `best_score`** carried forward (the iteration-1 baseline if nothing
  has been kept yet). This is `no_change`'s only honest value: the best is *unchanged*, so the score
  is *unchanged*. **Never send `0`** — `0` reads as a catastrophic regression a naive chart plots as
  a cliff. Carried-forward best plots as a flat line, which is the truth.
- `tags`: `decision:no_change` — **this tag, not the value, is the discriminator.** A `score_value`
  alone can never distinguish a no-eval carry-forward from a genuinely-measured `0`; only the
  `decision` tag can. Consumers of `auto_experiment_score` **must** branch on `decision` — exclude
  `decision:no_change` from any score aggregate (mean/best-pick), since its value is a marker, not a
  measurement.
- `reasoning`: state plainly that no full eval ran, why (e.g. the probe result), and that the value
  is the carried-forward best — not a measured score.

So `no_change` is still submitted (one metric, as every iteration), but it is unambiguously a
non-measurement: carried-forward value + `decision:no_change`. Do **not** tag it `kept`/`discarded`
(those assert a real measurement) and do **not** overload the value to signal state.

## Stop conditions & guards

- Stop when `iteration == max_iterations`.
- **Plateau within noise — stop early.** If the last **3** iterations all landed `discarded`
  *within noise* (no delta reached t-test significance, `|t| < 2`), stop and report the
  current best with `stop_reason: "plateau (deltas within noise)"`. Continuing past a noise plateau
  just burns budget generating within-noise wiggle; escalate instead (a new census bucket, a
  different dimension, or accept the ceiling). Distinguish this from a real regression streak.
- **A change with no computable score is `no_change`, never a fabricated number** (harness won't
  run / no new commit / judge unreachable / feasibility probe reached 0). Record the blocker in
  `reasoning`. Its LLM-Obs submission is the carried-forward marker (`decision:no_change`,
  `score_value` = current best), not a measured score — see **No-change iterations**.
- Track consecutive `no_change` iterations; after **5 in a row**, stop early and report the best
  result so far with a stop reason (do not keep burning iterations).

## Final report

1. Ask yourself the run-level wrap-up and write `final_result` into `config.json`:
   `{ "baseline_score", "best_score", "best_iteration", "best_sha", "iterations_run",
   "stop_reason", "reasoning", "noise_calibration" }` (reasoning = what was tried across all
   iterations, what worked, what didn't, why the winner won). `noise_calibration` records the
   Step 2.4 derivation — **this is where `runs`/`min_delta` are first shown to the user**, since
   they were never intake params:
   `{ "runs_pilot", "runs_final", "baseline_stdev", "run_means", "min_delta" }`. State in the
   summary that `runs`/`min_delta` were **computed from the measured baseline noise** (not chosen),
   with the reasoning, so the user sees the gate that actually governed every keep/discard decision.
2. **Higher-power confirmation of the top within-band candidate** (do this BEFORE the held-out
   test, and before naming the best). Scan every `discarded` iteration: if the one with the run's
   **best `val` mean in the goal's optimization direction** (highest for maximize, lowest for
   minimize) was discarded only because it was borderline-insignificant (`|t|` just under 2), moves
   in the goal's direction, and sits close to significance
   (`1 < |Δ| / SE_diff < 2`, same `SE_diff = √(after_stdev²/runs + best_stdev²/runs)` as the keep
   gate — not a pooled single-run stdev), it is **promising-but-underpowered**, not a
   confirmed null — exactly the case a low-run gate can't resolve. Re-run the **current best and
   that candidate back-to-back at the max `runs`** on `val` and **pool with the existing runs**
   (e.g. 10 + 10 → 20 per side). **Decide by the SAME keep gate as any iteration** (do not weaken
   it here): keep iff the candidate moves in the goal's direction AND `|t| = |Δ| / SE_diff ≥ 2`
   (`SE_diff = √(stdev_best²/n_best + stdev_cand²/n_cand)`) AND `|Δ| ≥ min_delta` — the practical
   floor still applies, so a higher-power rerun that shrinks `|Δ|` below `min_delta` does **not**
   promote (significance alone is not enough). If `SE_diff == 0`, decide by `|Δ| ≥ min_delta` in
   the goal's direction (zero-variance rule). The raw `pooled_stdev` does NOT shrink
   with more runs, so re-applying the per-iteration band here would discard a real effect no matter
   how much power you add — only `SE_diff` shrinks, which is the point of the extra runs. If the
   t-test is significant it becomes the best (update `best_sha`/`best_score`, record BOTH the raw
   band and the t-test); if not, leave it discarded with the higher-power numbers recorded. Do this
   for the **single** best candidate only — not every within-band wobble — per the rubric's
   **Higher-power confirmation** rule.
   - **Propagate a promotion to LLM-Obs.** The iteration's metric was already submitted with its
     iteration-level `decision:discarded`. If confirmation **promotes** it, that tag is now wrong —
     the dashboard would show the run's best as `discarded`. Re-submit that iteration's metric
     (same `iteration:<n>`, same sha, same `score_value`) with `decision:kept` plus a
     `promoted:higher_power_confirmation` tag and a `reasoning` stating it supersedes the earlier
     discarded decision (cite the t-test). This is the one sanctioned exception to "exactly one
     metric per iteration" — the later event is a correction, not a second measurement. Leave a
     genuinely-discarded candidate's metric as-is.
3. **Held-out `test` comparison (the real headline).** Run the harness once on the **baseline**
   commit and once on the **best** commit against `.auto_experiment/data.test.jsonl`
   (`AUTO_EXP_DATA=.auto_experiment/data.test.jsonl`), both at the derived `runs` count. Report the
   baseline-vs-best `test` delta with its two-sample t-test (`|t| = |Δ|/SE_diff ≥ 2` AND
   `|Δ| ≥ min_delta`; if `SE_diff == 0`, `|Δ| ≥ min_delta` in direction — same gate as every
   keep decision) as the run's result — the `val` hill-climb gain is not the headline. If `test` is
   not significant even though `val` was, say so explicitly (the win did not generalize) and treat
   baseline as best.
4. Print a per-iteration table (iteration, val delta, decision, sha) and name the best commit.
5. **If nothing beat the baseline on `test`**: report the baseline as the best result and leave the
   original code in place (`best_sha` empty). Do not fabricate an improvement.
6. Tell the user the scratch branch + best commit so they can open a PR from it if they want.
7. **Mark the experiment finished in LLM-Obs.** Call `update_llmobs_experiment` with
   `experiment_id` = `$DD_AUTO_EXPERIMENT_ID` (skip if unset) exactly once at the very end — after
   the last iteration, or immediately whenever you give up early. Set `status: "completed"` for any
   run that reached the final report (including one where baseline stayed best — a run that
   finished cleanly is completed, not failed). Set `status: "failed"` with a short `error` when the
   run could not finish — the harness never ran, setup was blocked, or you abandoned before any
   scored iteration. This status update is separate from the per-iteration metric submissions; make
   it once, last.

## Notes

- Every score is computed by running code. If you ever find yourself about to type a score
  number, stop — run the harness instead.
- Keep `.auto_experiment/` committed; it is the reproducible record of the run.
