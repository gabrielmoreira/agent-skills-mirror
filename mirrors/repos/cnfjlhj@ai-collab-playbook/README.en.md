# AI Collab Playbook

[中文](README.md) | English

I'm a PhD student in AI. Since the GPT-3.5 days I've been using AI heavily across research, writing, coding, and everyday learning. This repo is the accumulation of that experience.

This is not a tool list or a prompt cookbook. The question I keep coming back to is: once AI can participate in all these activities, how do you keep owning the problem, judging the quality, building experience — and stop yourself from outsourcing understanding?

**Treat AI as a colleague, not a tool — but the human is still the main variable.** AI can explore, generate, and execute, but problem framing, acceptance criteria, trade-offs, and final judgment should stay with you. Otherwise higher efficiency just means producing the illusion of progress, faster.

## Start Here

- **Full article**: [`docs/phd-ai-collab.md`](docs/phd-ai-collab.md)
- **Quick overview**: the three figures below, then jump to the matching sections in the article.
- **Reusable workflows**: [`skills/full/README.en.md`](skills/full/README.en.md) and [`prompts/`](prompts)
- **How I constrain agents**: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) / [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)

## What This Playbook Is About

**Human as the main variable.** AI amplifies capability, but it cannot replace problem awareness or judgment. You still need to know what you want, what counts as good, and what to drop.

**Colleague, not oracle.** Put AI into real workflows — not just Q&A windows. Selection-triggered tools, IM-based dispatch, remote agents: the closer the entry point is to your actual task, the more naturally AI gets used.

**Low-friction entry.** Not every task deserves a full agent pipeline. Lightweight one-off jobs should go to lightweight entry points — a selection toolbar, a chat message, a browser sidebar.

**Context first.** Prepare your goals, materials, preferences, and acceptance criteria before you hand off execution. AI output without context is barely better than dice rolls.

**Reusable practice.** Turn what works into Skills and Workflows — they get better and faster with reuse. But prune regularly; skill bloat is its own kind of noise.

**Anti-efficiency theater.** Beware of outsourcing understanding, taste, trade-offs, and learning itself to AI. Being efficient without understanding what you're doing is more dangerous than being slow.
