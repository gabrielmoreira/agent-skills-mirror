### Step 1: Download the skill from GitHub
1. Copy the URL of this specific skill folder from your browser's address bar.
2. Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/).
3. Paste the URL and click **Enter** to download.

### Step 2: Install the Skill in Claude
1. Open your **Claude desktop app**.
2. Go to the sidebar on the left side and click on the **Customize** section.
3. Click on the **Skills** tab, then click on the **+** (plus) icon button to create a new skill.
4. Choose the option to **Upload a skill**, and drag and drop the `.zip` file (or you can extract it and drop the folder, both work).

> **Note:** For some skills (like `position-me`), the `SKILL.md` file might be located inside a subfolder. Always make sure you are uploading the specific folder that contains the `SKILL.md` file!

## What It Does

- Generates 5 tagline variants with character counts (all under 60 chars)
- Writes a listing description under 500 characters
- Drafts a maker comment (300-400 words) that opens with the builder story, not "Hi PH!"
- Creates a launch day tweet thread (5-7 tweets, no hashtags)
- Writes a LinkedIn post for launch day
- Generates a 4-email sequence: existing users, newsletter, day-of reminder, follow-up
- Includes a launch checklist with timing and community guidelines

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose | How to Set Up |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Gemini API key | All copy generation | aistudio.google.com, Get API key |

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add GEMINI_API_KEY
```

## How to Use

Full launch kit:
```
"Generate a Product Hunt launch kit for my product"
"Prepare my PH listing and launch copy"
"Help me launch on Product Hunt"
```

Specific assets:
```
"Write my Product Hunt tagline for [product description]"
"Draft a maker comment for my PH launch"
"Write PH launch tweets"
```

From README:
```
"Generate a Product Hunt kit: my README is in this repo"
```

## Copy Constraints

| Asset | Limit | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Tagline | 60 chars | Hard limit, enforced by PH form |
| Description | 500 chars | Appears in search and email digests |
| Maker comment | 300-400 words | Post within 60 seconds of launch |
| Tweets | 280 chars each | No hashtags on technical threads |

## Maker Comment Strategy

The maker comment drives more PH success than any other single action. It should:

- Open with the real builder story (not "Hi PH! We're excited to announce...")
- Include at least one technical detail about how it works
- Acknowledge what the product does NOT do
- End with a specific question that invites comments

The comment goes live as your first reply to your own listing, within 60 seconds of the product going live at 12:01 AM PST.

## Launch Timing

Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

Avoid: Friday afternoons, holiday weeks, major tech conference days

The first 4 hours determine front page placement. Notify your audience before midnight PST on launch day so they are ready.
