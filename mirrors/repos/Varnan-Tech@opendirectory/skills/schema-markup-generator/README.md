Generate valid JSON-LD structured data for any webpage. The agent crawls the page, detects which schema types apply, and outputs a script tag ready to paste into your HTML. Optionally opens a GitHub PR with the markup injected.

## Install

```bash
npx "@opendirectory.dev/skills" install schema-markup-generator --target claude
```

### Video Tutorial

### Step 1: Download the skill from GitHub
1. Copy the URL of this specific skill folder from your browser's address bar.
2. Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/).
3. Paste the URL and click **Enter** to download.

### Step 2: Install the Skill in Claude
1. Open your **Claude desktop app**.
2. Go to the sidebar on the left side and click on the **Customize** section.
3. Click on the **Skills** tab, then click on the **+** (plus) icon button to create a new skill.
4. Choose the option to **Upload a skill**, and drag and drop the `.zip` file (or you can extract it and drop the folder, both work).

> **Note:** For some skills (like `position-me`), the `SKILL.md` file might be located inside a subfolder. Always make sure you are uploading the specific folder that contains the `SKILL.md` file!

## Schema Types Supported

| Type | Use When |
|------|----------|
| FAQPage | Page has 2 or more visible question/answer pairs |
| Article / BlogPosting | Page is a blog post or editorial article |
| Organization | Page represents a company or institution |
| Product | Page sells or describes a product with pricing |
| WebSite | Homepage schema with optional sitelinks search |
| HowTo | Page is a step-by-step guide with numbered steps |
| BreadcrumbList | Page has visible breadcrumb navigation |
| SoftwareApplication | Page describes a software tool or app |
| LocalBusiness | Page represents a physical business location |

The agent detects the right type automatically. A single page often gets multiple types (a blog post gets Article and BreadcrumbList, a homepage gets WebSite and Organization).

## Requirements

No LLM API key needed. The agent reads the page and generates the markup.

Chrome is needed for JavaScript-rendered pages. For static HTML pages or when you paste HTML directly, Chrome is not required.

A GitHub token is optional. Without it, the agent outputs the markup as text for you to paste manually.

## Setup

### 1. Start Chrome with remote debugging (for live URLs)

```bash
# macOS
open -a "Google Chrome" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222

# Linux
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

### 2. Configure environment variables (optional)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add GITHUB_TOKEN if you want auto-PR support
```

## How to Use

From a live URL:

```
"Generate schema markup for https://example.com/faq"
"Add structured data to https://example.com/blog/my-post"
"What schema markup does this page need? https://example.com/about"
```

From pasted HTML:

```
"Generate schema markup for this page: [paste HTML]"
"Add JSON-LD to this HTML: [paste HTML]"
```

Targeting a specific type:

```
"Generate FAQPage schema for https://example.com/support"
"Add Organization schema to our about page: https://example.com/about"
"Generate Product schema for this page: https://example.com/products/pro"
```

With auto-PR:

```
"Generate schema markup for https://example.com/blog/post and open a GitHub PR"
```

## Output

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| JSON-LD script block | One `<script type="application/ld+json">` block per schema type |
| Placement instructions | Where to insert the block in your HTML or framework |
| MISSING field list | Required fields not found on the page that you need to fill in |
| GitHub PR | If GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_REPO are configured and you confirm |

## Validate Your Markup

After applying the markup, validate it at:

- Google Rich Results Test: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
- Schema.org Validator: https://validator.schema.org
