## Skills

### 1. `google-trends-api/`
The API layer — knows how to query Google Trends through SerpApi, handle responses, manage rate limits, and cache results.

### 2. `seo-keyword-research/`
The SEO workflow — uses Google Trends data to find breakout keywords, build content structure, and generate SEO-optimized blog outlines.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Get a free API key (250 searches/month)
# https://serpapi.com/

# 2. Set your key
export SERPAPI_KEY="your_key_here"

# 3. Install dependency
pip install requests

# 4. Run keyword research for a blog topic
python seo-keyword-research/scripts/blog_seo_research.py "kubernetes deployment"

# 5. Or just discover trending keywords
python google-trends-api/scripts/discover_keywords.py "AI developer tools"
```

## Directory Structure

## How It Works

```

  |
  v
[google-trends-api] RELATED_QUERIES -> finds "kubernetes vs docker" (Breakout!)
[google-trends-api] RELATED_TOPICS  -> finds "Helm", "CI/CD", "Container Orchestration"
  |
  v
[seo-keyword-research] Selects primary keyword, builds outline
