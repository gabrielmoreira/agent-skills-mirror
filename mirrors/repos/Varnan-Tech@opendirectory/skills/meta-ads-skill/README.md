## Overview

The **Meta Ads Skill** is a comprehensive, production-ready  skill designed to give LLMs and AI agents expert-level capabilities to orchestrate the official **Meta Ads Python CLI**.

By using this skill, an agent transforms into an **Expert Media Buyer**. It will know exactly how to explore ad structures, troubleshoot campaign performance (like CPA spikes), discover new audiences, and format massive Meta APIs JSON payloads into beautiful, readable markdown reports.

## For Agents: How to Use This Skill Efficiently

This skill is designed using a **Progressive Disclosure (Hub-and-Spoke)** architecture to maximize context window efficiency:

1. **The Hub (`SKILL.md`)**: The primary entry point. It provides strict guardrails, safety protocols, and the authentication troubleshooting workflow.
2. **The Spokes (`references/`)**: 
   - When you need to perform a specific task (e.g., investigating a CPA spike), read `references/workflows.md` for the exact step-by-step orchestration strategy.
   - When presenting data to the user, read `references/report_templates.md` to strictly follow the required Markdown layout.

###  Strict Agent Guardrails
* **Context Protection**: ALWAYS default to `time_range="last_7d"` for insights. ALWAYS use `limit=10` for listing campaigns/adsets initially.
* **Safety First**: NEVER execute state-changing tools (`create_campaign`, `update_campaign`) without explicitly showing the parameters to the user and waiting for their affirmative confirmation.

## Installation & Setup

To use this skill, you must install the official Meta Ads CLI and configure your credentials.

### 1. Install the CLI
The skill relies on the `meta-ads` Python package:
```bash
pip install meta-ads
```

### 2. Authentication (System User Token)
The CLI uses a **System User Access Token** for authentication. 
1. Generate a System User Token in your [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/settings/system-users).
2. Ensure the token has `ads_management`, `ads_read`, and `read_insights` permissions.
3. Set the following environment variables on your machine:

```bash
export ACCESS_TOKEN="your_system_user_access_token"
export AD_ACCOUNT_ID="act_your_ad_account_id"
```
