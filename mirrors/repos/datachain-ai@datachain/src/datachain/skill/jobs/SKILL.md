You are now loaded with the datachain-jobs skill. Maintain a jobs analytics file at `dc-knowledge/jobs/index.md`. Follow the 3-step flow below exactly.

## Step 1 — Check Staleness

```
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/jobs.py --plan
```

- If `"studio_available": false` → report the `error` message and stop.
- If `"up_to_date": true` → skip to Step 3.
- If `"up_to_date": false` → continue to Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — Fetch & Write

```
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/jobs.py --fetch [--days N] [--limit N] [--enrich]
```

- Use `--days N` from the user's request if stated (e.g. "last 7 days" → `--days 7`). Default: `--days 30`.
- Add `--enrich` only when the question requires duration, workers, or cluster data AND `enriched: false` in an existing index — tell the user it makes one API call per terminal job.
- If the script fails → report the error and stop.

Write `dc-knowledge/jobs/index.md` using EXACTLY this format:

```markdown
---
generated: <generated from script output>
days_covered: <days_covered>
total_jobs: <filtered_count>
failed_count: <failed_count>
complete_count: <complete_count>
running_count: <running_count>
other_count: <other_count>
enriched: <true|false>
duration_note: "Wall-clock duration (submit→finish). Null when enriched=false or job still running."
truncated: <true|false>
---

## Clusters

| Name | Cloud | Max Workers | Default |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| <name> | <cloud_provider> | <max_workers> | <yes if is_default else no> |

## Jobs

| Date | ID | Name | Status | User | Workers | Duration | Cluster | Python |
|------|----|------|--------|------|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| <created_display> | <id> | <name> | <status> | <created_by> | <workers> | <duration_str or —> | <cluster_name or —> | <python_version or —> |
```

**Section rules:**
- Omit `## Clusters` if the `clusters` array is empty.
- Duration cell: `duration_str` value (e.g. `"9000s"`) when known, `—` when null.
- Workers: always a number (`workers` field, defaults to 1).
- Cluster, Python: use `—` when null.
- Date column: `created_display` (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` UTC).
- Rows: newest-first (already sorted by script).
- If `truncated: true`, add after the table: `_(Results truncated at <limit> jobs. Use --limit N for more.)_`

## Step 3 — Answer

Read `dc-knowledge/jobs/index.md` and answer the user's question.

### Duration arithmetic
Duration cells contain plain seconds strings like `"9000s"`. Parse the integer before `s`, sum, then convert:
- Example: filter rows for user "alice" in the last 7 days, sum all Duration values → total seconds → divide by 3600 for hours.
- If all Duration cells are `—` (enriched: false) → say: "Duration data requires enrichment. Re-fetch with: `python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/jobs.py --fetch --enrich`" and offer to do so.

### Failure rate
- Overall: `failed_count / total_jobs * 100` from frontmatter.
- Per user or per day: count rows matching Status = `failed` in the table.

### Price estimation
When the user asks for cost:
1. If hourly rate unknown → ask: "What is the instance hourly rate in $/hr? (e.g. `3.20` for $3.20/hr)"
2. If Workers column is all `—` → ask: "How many workers per job?" or compute single-worker cost and note it.
3. Compute per job: `duration_seconds / 3600 × rate × workers`. Group by user/day/cluster as requested.
4. Present as a table: User | Compute-hours | Est. cost (@$X/hr × N workers)

### Per-cluster / per-user analytics
Filter the Jobs table by the Cluster or User column. Aggregate `(Ns)` Duration values for totals.
