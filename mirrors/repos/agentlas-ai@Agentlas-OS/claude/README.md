# Claude Code Plugin Install

Install from a new computer with the OS terminal:

On a fresh Mac, install Apple Command Line Tools first if `git` is unavailable:

```bash
xcode-select --install
git --version
```

One-command install or update for Claude, Codex, and Gemini:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Agentlas-OS/main/scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh | bash
```

Optional global router prompt block:

```bash
hep-global install --target claude
```

This appends a managed Hephaestus block to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, so ordinary
Claude Code prompts use Network federation unless the request explicitly names
Local, Cloud, or Hub. Exact scopes never widen. If a requested source is
blocked by credits, entitlement, availability, or fit, Claude Code reports
that boundary. Claude Code should announce final workers as `Agents
used: ...` in English contexts or `사용 에이전트: ...` in Korean contexts, not as
`hep-network`. Use `hep-global remove --target claude` to remove only that
managed block.

Claude Code global router commands:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `hep-global install --target claude` | Install or refresh only `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. |
| `hep-global status --target claude` | Check whether the Claude Code router block is installed. |
| `hep-global remove --target claude` | Remove only the managed Claude Code router block. |
| `hep-global install --target claude --dry-run` | Preview the Claude Code edit without writing files. |
| `hep-global install --target claude --no-backup` | Edit without writing a timestamped backup. |
| `hephaestus global install --target claude` | Same command through the main runner. |
| `~/.agentlas/runtime/current/bin/hephaestus global status --target claude` | Use the installed runtime directly when `hep-global` is not on `PATH`. |

To enable this during one-command install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Agentlas-OS/main/scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh | HEPHAESTUS_INSTALL_GLOBAL_ROUTER=1 bash
```

The one-command installer registers the shared runtime and adapters. Desktop
startup and `/hep-*` commands start a digest-verified, rate-limited update in
the background without delaying the current task. A successful update moves
`~/.agentlas/runtime/current` atomically and reconciles the installed Claude
adapter. Use `/reload-plugins` or start a new session to load new plugin code.

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/agentlas-ai/Agentlas-OS --sparse .claude-plugin claude/plugins
claude plugin install hephaestus@agentlas-core-engine
```

Those two plugin-manager commands expose Claude's required namespaced command,
`/hephaestus:hep-build`. The one-command installer at the top additionally
writes standalone user commands to `~/.claude/commands/hep-*.md`, which is what
makes the shorter `/hep-build` surface persist in autocomplete across new
sessions.

After the one-command installer, open or restart Claude Code in the project and
type:

```text
/reload-plugins
/hep-build ontology
```

After a plugin-only install, use `/hephaestus:hep-build ontology` instead.

If an older install still points at `agentlas-meta-agent`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Agentlas-OS/main/scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh | bash
```

That command creates and opens:

```text
.agentlas/ontology-gui/index.html
```

Use the same slash command for builder work:

```text
/hep-build create a research agent for SEC filing analysis
/hep-build package this existing Claude agent into Agentlas architecture
/hep-network split this launch into research, copy, QA, and release agents
/hep-local staff this only from agents registered on this machine
/hep-cloud use my saved analyst agent
/hep-hub find only public Hub agents for accessibility QA
/hep-search find agents for market report research
/hep-browser https://example.com
/hep-call market-researcher, report-writer {draft a market report brief}
/hep-connect Telegram for Marketing Agent Team
```

The plugin registers one Workforce MCP, `hephaestus-network`, backed by local
Agentlas OS Core. Its public staffing tools are
`workforce.search_candidates`, `workforce.validate_selection`, and
`workforce.prepare_execution`. Core reaches Cloud and Hub internally; adding a
second direct `agentlas` MCP would bypass the local federation/privacy boundary.

After generation, the final handoff must include `global_commands` for the
created agent or team. For teams, that command routes to the orchestrator/HQ.

Local validation from this repository:

```bash
claude plugin validate claude/plugins/agentlas-core-engine-meta-agent
claude plugin validate claude
```

Local checkout install:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./claude
claude plugin install hephaestus@agentlas-core-engine
```

Use directly for one Claude session without installing:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir claude/plugins/agentlas-core-engine-meta-agent
```
