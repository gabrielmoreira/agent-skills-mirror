# /agentlas

Single entry point for every Agentlas command. `/agentlas <command> <request>`
does exactly what `/hep-<command> <request>` does. Both names stay supported and
neither is deprecated — this command only spells the product name out loud.

Read the first whitespace-delimited token of the argument as COMMAND, and treat
everything after it as REQUEST, verbatim.

COMMAND is one of:
`network`, `build`, `storm`, `call`, `search`, `hub`, `local`, `cloud`,
`browser`, `connect`, `upload`, `graph`, `one`, `login`, `orch`, `update`.

If COMMAND is missing, or is not in that list, print the list, ask which one the
user meant, and stop. Never guess a command, and never improvise a workflow from
memory.

Otherwise resolve the canonical workflow file for that command:

```bash
cmd="$COMMAND"
if [[ "$cmd" == "one" || "$cmd" == "agentlas-one" ]]; then
  target="agentlas-one.md"
elif [[ "$cmd" == "graph" ]]; then
  target="hep-graph.md"
else
  target="hep-${cmd}.md"
fi
ls "$HOME/.agentlas/runtime/current/host_adapters"/*/prompts/"$target"    "$HOME/.agentlas/runtime/current/host_adapters"/*/plugins/*/commands/"$target"    2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Read the file that resolves and follow its instructions exactly, using REQUEST
as the request. **That file is the authority.** The table above only chooses
which file to read; it adds no behaviour of its own, so the two spellings can
never drift apart.

If nothing resolves, report that the Agentlas runtime is missing or incomplete
and suggest `hephaestus update`. Do not substitute a remembered version of the
workflow.
