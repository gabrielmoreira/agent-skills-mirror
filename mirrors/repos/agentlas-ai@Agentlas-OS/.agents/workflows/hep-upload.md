# /hep-upload

Upload an Agentlas agent package. The argument is the exact text the user typed
after `/hep-upload` — usually an agent folder, possibly empty.

## Step 1 — Ask the destination first

Always ask this before doing anything else, even if the arguments already say
upload, publish, add, Cloud, Hub, or a target folder:

```text
Cloud에 업로드 할까요? 다른사람들이 볼 수 없어요.
Upload to Cloud? Other people cannot see it.

Agentlas Hub에 업로드 할까요? 다른 사람들이 빌려 쓸 수 있어요.
Upload to Agentlas Hub? Other people can borrow it.
```

Do not package, publish, register, add-source, reindex, or call any upload API
until the user answers **Cloud** or **Agentlas Hub**. If the destination is
answered but the target folder is ambiguous, ask for the exact agent folder
before running anything.

If the destination is **Agentlas Hub**, ask what it should charge before
uploading. Skip this for Cloud/private-link — a private save is not listed and
nobody can hire it.

```text
값을 정하시겠어요? 비워 두면 그 항목은 팔지 않습니다.
Set a price? Leave one out and that kind is simply not sold.

  빌리기 / Rent      워크오더 1건 · 24시간   1-100 크레딧
  인제스트 / Ingest   프로젝트 1개 · 하루     1-2000 크레딧
  포크 / Fork        사본 1개 · 1회         1 크레딧 이상

전부 비워 두면 무료로 불립니다. 나중에 agentlas.cloud 수익 페이지에서도 정할 수 있습니다.
Leave them all blank and it stays free to call — you can price it later on the web.
```

Blank is NOT zero: leave the flag out entirely. Never pass `0`, never invent a
number, and treat "all three blank" as a complete answer — the agent is then
callable for free, which is a supported state. Pass what they answered as
`--rent-credits N`, `--ingest-credits N`, `--fork-credits N`.

## Step 2 — Resolve the runner

After the user has chosen a destination, resolve the runner by **absolute
path**. Do not ask the user to open a separate terminal.

```bash
RUNNER=""
for candidate in \
  "$HOME/.agentlas/runtime/current/bin/hephaestus" \
  "./bin/hephaestus"
do
  if [ -n "$candidate" ] && [ -x "$candidate" ]; then RUNNER="$candidate"; break; fi
done
if [ -z "$RUNNER" ]; then
  for cache in "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/agentlas-core-engine/hephaestus" \
               "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/agentlas-core-engine/hephaestus"; do
    newest="$(ls -d "$cache"/*/bin/hephaestus 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)"
    if [ -n "$newest" ] && [ -x "$newest" ]; then RUNNER="$newest"; break; fi
  done
fi
[ -n "$RUNNER" ] || { echo "Hephaestus runtime not found. Run the installer first." >&2; exit 1; }
echo "RUNNER=$RUNNER"
```

## Step 3 — Preview or publish one immutable snapshot

Never run `package` and then `publish`; that packages twice. Use one explicit
`hep-upload` command, which snapshots, validates, and submits one artifact:

- Cloud: `"$RUNNER" hep-upload <agent-folder> --visibility private-link`
- Agentlas Hub: `"$RUNNER" hep-upload <agent-folder> --visibility marketplace [--rent-credits N] [--ingest-credits N] [--fork-credits N]`

All security and content findings are advisory. Never instruct the user to
block, abort, or postpone upload because of a finding. Continue with safe bytes:
omit affected source items with omission receipts, or attach an `engine-gap`
receipt when the engine cannot safely represent or repair an item, then upload
the remaining package. Keep the findings and receipts visible.

If the user asks to preview, add `--dry-run`, retain the returned
`manifest.packageHash` and `uploadReceipt.receipt`, then append
`--expected-package-hash <manifest.packageHash> --expected-upload-receipt
<uploadReceipt.receipt>` to the one later publish. Stop on any hash or receipt
mismatch.

On `overwrite_confirmation_required`, show the exact returned Cloud ID and ask
for approval. Only after approval append `--overwrite-cloud-id <exact-cloud-id>`.
Never infer overwrite permission from a matching slug. Preserve exact auth,
credit, ownership, and destination refusal codes; never switch destinations.

Report success only when the response attests the exact slug, visibility,
package hash, immutable release ID/version, and content digest.

## Workforce résumé repair loop

If registration returns `workforce_resume_incomplete`, the server refused the
card because its `workforce` block
does not match the hub standard résumé. The error carries the exact
mismatches and seed ontology examples. YOU repair it — the platform never
edits the card for you: use stable English `role:*`, `community:*`, `skill:*`,
and `knowledge:*` IDs that actually describe the agent. Returned examples are
aliases, not an allowlist. Rerun the upload and repeat until registration
succeeds.
