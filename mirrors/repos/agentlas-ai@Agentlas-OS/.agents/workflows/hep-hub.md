# /hep-hub

Use local MCP server `hephaestus-network` and exact `sourceScope: "hub"` for
the request after `/hep-hub`. Author a redacted WorkOrder, call
`workforce.search_candidates` with `{workOrder, sourceScope: "hub"}` and keep
`federationResult`; author the final host-LLM Selection; call
`workforce.validate_selection` with
`{workOrder, candidateSet: federationResult.candidateSet, selection,
federationResult}` and keep `federatedSelection`; then call
`workforce.prepare_execution` with
`{workOrder, candidateSet: federationResult.candidateSet, selection,
federationResult, federatedSelection}`. Retain
source `hub` and every immutable pin; execute planner/manager, workers,
synthesis, and verifier as distinct invocations.

If Hub refuses or is unavailable, report its exact source receipt. Never
search Local or Cloud, bypass Core with direct remote search, accept a
deterministic picker, or claim execution from preparation alone.
