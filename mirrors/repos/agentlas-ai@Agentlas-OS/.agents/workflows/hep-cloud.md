# /hep-cloud

Use local MCP server `hephaestus-network` and exact `sourceScope: "cloud"` for
the request after `/hep-cloud`. Author a redacted WorkOrder, call
`workforce.search_candidates` with `{workOrder, sourceScope: "cloud"}` and keep
`federationResult`; author the final host-LLM Selection; call
`workforce.validate_selection` with
`{workOrder, candidateSet: federationResult.candidateSet, selection,
federationResult}` and keep `federatedSelection`; then call
`workforce.prepare_execution` with
`{workOrder, candidateSet: federationResult.candidateSet, selection,
federationResult, federatedSelection}`. Retain
source `cloud` and every immutable pin; execute planner/manager, workers,
synthesis, and verifier as distinct invocations.

If owner authentication or Cloud is unavailable, report `source_unavailable`
with the Core receipt. Never search Local or public Hub, call legacy routing,
accept a deterministic picker, or claim execution from preparation alone.
