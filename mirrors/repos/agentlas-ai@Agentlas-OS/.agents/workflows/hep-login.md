Update fallback: 자동 업데이트가 안 되면 `hephaestus update`를 한 번 실행하세요. 업데이트하지 않아도 현재 버전 명령은 그대로 동작합니다.

# /hep-login

Sign this machine into Agentlas so cloud staffing, uploads, and paid Hub calls
work. Raw request: `the request typed after the command`

Resolve the runner (authentication only):

```bash
RUNNER=""
for candidate in \
  "$HOME/.agentlas/runtime/current/bin/hephaestus" \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/hephaestus}" \
  "${PLUGIN_ROOT:+$PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/hephaestus}" \
  "${GEMINI_EXTENSION_ROOT:+$GEMINI_EXTENSION_ROOT/bin/hephaestus}" \
  "./bin/hephaestus"
do
  if [ -n "$candidate" ] && [ -x "$candidate" ]; then RUNNER="$candidate"; break; fi
done
"$RUNNER" auth login --timeout 570
```

1. Run the login command above in the foreground and wait for it — it opens
   the browser sign-in window and blocks until the user finishes (up to ~10
   minutes). Tell the user, in their language, that a browser sign-in window
   just opened and they should complete it there.
2. If the output prints an authorization URL line instead (the browser could
   not be opened), show that URL to the user as a clickable link and keep the
   command running — clicking it completes the same sign-in.
3. When it exits, run `"$RUNNER" auth status` and report plainly:
   `authenticated` (say sign-in is done and cloud commands now work) or
   `signed_out` (say it did not complete, show the exact error line, and offer
   to run `/hep-login` again).
4. Never print token values. Never paste the user's credentials anywhere.
   If the user asked for something else after `/hep-login` (extra words in the
   raw request), treat sign-in as the prerequisite step and continue with that
   request only after `authenticated`.
