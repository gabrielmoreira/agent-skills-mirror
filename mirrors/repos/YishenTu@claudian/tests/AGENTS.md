# Test constraints

- Use package test commands: `npm run test:unit -- --runTestsByPath <path>` runs either a unit or integration Jest file with the required Node local-storage option. `npm run test` also runs script/architecture/config checks; targeted Jest does not. `tests/compatibility/` runs only through `npm run test:lan-compatibility`, which needs public registry access.
- Integration tests keep interacting owned modules real; use narrow public ports only for environment, Obsidian, provider, or other dependencies outside the behavior under test. Do not add production facades solely for testing.
- Shared provider changes need neutral-contract coverage and distinct native adapter cases.
- DOM interaction and accessibility regressions need real-DOM tests with Testing Library role/name queries and targeted `jest-axe` checks. Isolated controller logic may use unit tests without a DOM; `MockElement` class/tag assertions do not establish accessibility or keyboard behavior.
