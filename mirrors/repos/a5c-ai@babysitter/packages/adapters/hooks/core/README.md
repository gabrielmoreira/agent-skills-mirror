# @a5c-ai/hooks-adapter-core

Canonical schemas, types, session store, merge engine, and programmatic runtime for hooks-adapter.

## Install

This package ships the built runtime in `dist/` and this package README for npm publish-surface auditing.

import {
  createHooksEngine,
  createAdapter,

} from "@a5c-ai/hooks-adapter-core";
```

The public surface includes:

- canonical event, result, adapter, plan, and session types
- normalization, merge, propagation, and diagnostics helpers
- session-store utilities and harness discovery
- the programmatic hooks engine for in-process integrations
