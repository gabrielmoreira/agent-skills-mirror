# Everywhere Agent Guidelines

This file contains repository-wide rules. Keep it short enough to read before every task.
Topic-specific guidance lives under `docs/References` and must be read only when the task touches the corresponding area.

## Required References

- For Avalonia controls, Views, Presentation objects, DynamicData-backed UI collections, virtualization, or UI animation, read [`docs/References/AvaloniaViewPresentation.md`](docs/References/AvaloniaViewPresentation.md) before making changes.

## Source of Truth and Change Discipline

- Inspect the current implementation and its call sites before changing it. Design documents may lag behind the code after later refactoring and are not automatically authoritative.
- Preserve unrelated and uncommitted user changes. Do not clean up, revert, reformat, or otherwise alter files outside the task's scope.
- Do not run repository-wide or file-wide formatting when it would create unrelated diffs. Format only the code affected by the task.
- Discuss new NuGet packages or other dependencies with the user before introducing them, especially when the existing code can implement the requirement at a reasonable cost.
- Remove obsolete compatibility layers when they have no real callers and are not required by a public API, serialized format, or other compatibility boundary.

## C# Style and Type Layout

- Follow standard .NET naming conventions, including .NET capitalization of acronyms.
- Use `var` for all local variable declarations.
- Prefer expression-bodied members (`=>`) for simple members.
- Prefer guard clauses and early returns over unnecessary nesting.
- Within a type, normally order member categories as follows:
  1. properties;
  2. events;
  3. fields;
  4. methods.
- Static or readonly members may be placed earlier within their category when that improves readability. Do not mechanically reorder existing code solely to enforce this preference.
- Non-constant fields must be `private`. Constants may use the visibility appropriate to their API, including `public` or `internal`.
- Public nested types may appear at the beginning or end of their containing type. Place private nested types at the end.
- Do not retain unused positional-record parameters. They become captured state and implicitly participate in generated equality, hashing, and string formatting.
- `#region` is allowed when it genuinely improves navigation; it is not a substitute for a well-factored type.

## Architecture and Production APIs

- Optimize for the application's real ownership, call paths, and lifetime. Do not design internal APIs as generic libraries for hypothetical consumers.
- Prefer fewer states, objects, synchronization mechanisms, and intermediate abstractions, but never at the cost of stable identity, incremental updates, correct lifetime, or readability.
- Constructors must express a clear production purpose. Avoid ambiguous default parameters, forwarding-only constructor chains, and constructors added solely for tests.
- Do not add production methods, constructors, properties, or other hooks solely to make tests easier. Tests should use normal production entry points, mocks, reflection, or `UnsafeAccessor` where appropriate. Reconsider tests that would materially distort the production design.

## Comments and Documentation

- Write all code comments and XML documentation comments in English.
- Preserve useful existing comments during refactoring. Do not remove documentation merely because the surrounding implementation is being rewritten.
- Document non-obvious lifetime rules, thread boundaries, state transitions, algorithms, and performance tradeoffs in enough detail for a future maintainer to understand why the design exists.
- Write technical specifications in English under an appropriate subdirectory of `docs`.

## Localization

- Everywhere uses source-generated localization APIs. Use those APIs instead of manually maintained resource accessors.
- When adding or changing localized text, edit only:
  - `src/Everywhere.Core/I18N/Strings.resx`;
  - `src/Everywhere.Core/I18N/Strings.zh-hans.resx`.
- Do not edit any other locale-specific RESX file. GitHub Actions generates or updates those translations automatically.
- Name localization keys after their current semantic meaning and owning area. Do not preserve an obsolete feature prefix after a value becomes shared.
- Prefix genuinely shared localization keys with `Common_`.

## Tests

- Name test methods in PascalCase, with underscores separating the scenario, action, and expected result. For example: `UpdateContent_WhenConditionBecomesFalse_ClearsChild`.
- Follow the repository's existing build and test practices and choose verification proportionate to the scope and risk of the change.
