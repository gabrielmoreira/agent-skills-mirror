# Skill: Fix design notes

Every PR that records evidence screenshots gets an advisory design review. Its
notes ride in the **Evidence preview** check, next to the evidence they are
about: one summary line, and the notes as the check's text. They never change
the evidence verdict, but a note marked *Worth fixing* is a defect a careful
designer would send back. Fix it, or say in the PR why the screen is right.

## Read the notes

```bash
sha=$(gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)
check() { gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/$sha/check-runs?check_name=Evidence%20preview" --jq ".check_runs[0].output.$1"; }
check summary   # ends with "Design review (advisory): 3 notes, 1 worth fixing." or "no notes."
check text      # the notes, then the same notes as JSON
```

Each note gives:

| Field | Use it to |
| --- | --- |
| rule | `layout.*` was measured from the DOM (exact). `S2`, `V2`… are DESIGN.md; `OW-*` are the OpenWork Design rules in `evals/design-review/rubric.md` (judged from pixels; may vary run to run) |
| Screenshot | the spec step that took it, and the spec file |
| Where in the code | grep for the hook (`[data-library-row="…"]` → `data-library-row`) or the class list to find the component |
| Reproduce | the command that re-records the screenshots and reviews them locally |

The JSON block at the end of the check text has the same notes for scripts. The
screenshots themselves are in the review report the check links to.

## Reproduce, fix, verify

1. Run the note's reproduce command. Read `--json` output, not prose:
   `pnpm evals:e2e <slug> --local && pnpm --dir evals design:review -- --test-run latest --json`
   (judged notes need `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; measured ones do not).
2. Find the component from the hook or class list. Read DESIGN.md and the rule
   in `evals/design-review/rubric.md` before changing anything: the fix follows
   the team's pattern, not the note's wording.
3. Fix it in the product code, never in the spec or the rubric.
4. Re-run the same command. The note must be gone and no new *Worth fixing*
   note may appear. Look at the screenshot yourself: a passing rule is not a
   good screen.
5. Push. CI re-runs the review; the evidence check's summary says
   `Design review (advisory): no notes.` or lists only what you decided to keep.

## When the screen is right

A judged note can be wrong, and a team decision can outrank a generic rule.
Leave the code, and put one line in the PR body under Evidence:
`Design review: kept OW-LIST-HEADER on the Library; the columns are compared (see DESIGN.md S2).`
Do not edit the rubric to silence a note in the same PR that triggers it.

## Rules

- Measured notes are facts about the layout; do not argue with the numbers.
- Never chase a judged note across runs: if it flips between runs, it is low
  confidence. Fix what you can see in the screenshot.
- Fix the shared component when the hook points at one (a row used by every
  list), not each screen.
