# UI Patterns

Shared UI patterns, component library, and design system conventions for the Maestro renderer.

---

## Modal System (LayerStack)

Maestro uses a centralized **LayerStack** to manage all modals, overlays, and search interfaces. Every dismissable UI surface registers with the stack so that Escape always closes the topmost layer first.

### Architecture

```text
LayerStackProvider          (src/renderer/contexts/LayerStackContext.tsx)
  -> useLayerStack hook     (src/renderer/hooks/ui/useLayerStack.ts)
  -> useModalLayer hook     (src/renderer/hooks/ui/useModalLayer.ts)
  -> Layer types            (src/renderer/types/layer.ts)
  -> Priority constants     (src/renderer/constants/modalPriorities.ts)
```

### Layer Types

Two discriminated-union variants defined in `src/renderer/types/layer.ts`:

| Type      | Purpose                                            | Extras                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `modal`   | Full dialogs that block the UI                     | `isDirty`, `onBeforeClose`, `parentModalId` |
| `overlay` | Semi-transparent surfaces (file preview, lightbox) | `allowClickOutside`                         |

Both share `BaseLayer` fields: `id`, `priority`, `blocksLowerLayers`, `capturesFocus`, `focusTrap`, `ariaLabel`.

Focus trap modes:

- `strict` - Tab cycles within the layer (default for modals)
- `lenient` - Layer captures keyboard events but focus can leave
- `none` - No focus trapping

### Priority Ranges

Defined in `src/renderer/constants/modalPriorities.ts`:

| Range   | Purpose                  | Examples                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1000+   | Critical / celebrations  | `QUIT_CONFIRM` (1020), `CONFIRM` (1000), `STANDING_OVATION` (1100) |
| 900-999 | High-priority mutations  | `RENAME_INSTANCE` (900), `GIST_PUBLISH` (980)                      |
| 700-899 | Standard modals          | `NEW_INSTANCE` (750), `BATCH_RUNNER` (720), `QUICK_ACTION` (700)   |
| 400-699 | Settings and info        | `SETTINGS` (450), `ABOUT` (600), `USAGE_DASHBOARD` (540)           |
| 100-399 | Overlays and previews    | `FILE_PREVIEW` (100), `GIT_DIFF` (200), `LIGHTBOX` (150)           |
| 1-99    | Autocomplete and filters | `SLASH_AUTOCOMPLETE` (50), `FILE_TREE_FILTER` (30)                 |

### Registering a Modal

Use the `useModalLayer` hook. It handles register-on-mount, unregister-on-unmount, and handler updates:

```tsx
import { useModalLayer } from '../../hooks';
import { MODAL_PRIORITIES } from '../../constants/modalPriorities';

function MyModal({ onClose }: { onClose: () => void }) {
	useModalLayer(MODAL_PRIORITIES.MY_MODAL, 'My Modal', onClose);

	return <div>...</div>;
}
```

With options (dirty state, before-close confirmation):

```tsx
useModalLayer(MODAL_PRIORITIES.EDITOR, 'Editor', onClose, {
	isDirty: hasUnsavedChanges,
	onBeforeClose: async () => {
		return await confirmDiscard();
	},
	focusTrap: 'strict',
	blocksLowerLayers: true,
});
```

### Using the `<Modal>` Component

The `<Modal>` component (`src/renderer/components/ui/Modal.tsx`) wraps `useModalLayer` with standardized styling:

```tsx
import { Modal, ModalFooter } from '../../components/ui/Modal';
import { MODAL_PRIORITIES } from '../../constants/modalPriorities';

function SettingsModal({ theme, onClose }: Props) {
	return (
		<Modal
			theme={theme}
			title="Settings"
			priority={MODAL_PRIORITIES.SETTINGS}
			onClose={onClose}
			width={500}
			footer={
				<ModalFooter
					theme={theme}
					onCancel={onClose}
					onConfirm={handleSave}
					confirmLabel="Save"
					confirmDisabled={!isValid}
				/>
			}
		>
			{/* modal content */}
		</Modal>
	);
}
```

`<Modal>` props of note:

- `closeOnBackdropClick` - defaults to `false`
- `showHeader` / `showCloseButton` - toggle header elements
- `customHeader` / `headerIcon` - customize the header
- `initialFocusRef` - element to auto-focus on mount
- `layerOptions` - pass-through to `useModalLayer`

`<ModalFooter>` provides a standard cancel/confirm button pair with optional `destructive` styling (red confirm button).

### Modal Sizing (max footprint)

**The Maestro Cue modal (`90vw x 90vh`) is the maximum modal size.** No modal should exceed it - not even an "expanded" or "fullscreen" state. The Cue modal (`src/renderer/components/CueModal/CueModal.tsx`) sets `width: '90vw'; height: '90vh'` on its container; treat that as the app-wide ceiling.

Guidance:

- A large, content-heavy modal (dashboards, editors, the expanded Prompt Composer) caps at `w-[90vw] h-[90vh]`.
- A compact modal that has a roomier "expanded" mode toggles between a capped default (e.g. `w-[90vw] h-[80vh] max-w-5xl`) and the `90vw x 90vh` ceiling - never `w-screen h-screen`. Staying off the screen edges keeps the modal clear of the OS title bar / traffic lights, so no per-platform inset gymnastics are needed.
- Standard form/dialog modals use the `<Modal>` component's `width` prop (a fixed pixel width) and size their height to content.

The expanded Prompt Composer (`src/renderer/components/PromptComposerModal.tsx`) is the reference implementation of the compact-vs-`90vw x 90vh` toggle.

### Resizable Modals

A modal opts into drag-to-resize by passing `resizeKey` to `<Modal>`. Do NOT hand-roll a resize handle, a `ResizeObserver`, or CSS `resize: both` - the shared path already covers persistence, minimums, and viewport clamping.

```tsx
<Modal
	theme={theme}
	title="About Maestro"
	priority={MODAL_PRIORITIES.ABOUT}
	onClose={onClose}
	width={560} // default size before any resize
	resizeKey="about" // stable, unique; enables the corner grip
	minWidth={460} // floor for this modal's layout
	minHeight={420}
>
```

How it works:

- `useResizableModal` (`src/renderer/hooks/ui/useResizableModal.ts`) owns the drag. Like `useResizablePanel` it writes to the DOM during the drag and commits React state once on mouseup. Deltas are doubled because the card is centered: growing the width by W moves the right edge by only W/2, so doubling keeps the grip under the pointer.
- Sizes persist in one `modalSizes` map in `uiStore`, keyed by `resizeKey`, written through to settings and hydrated by `loadAllSettings` on startup.
- Minimums default to `MODAL_MIN_WIDTH` (360) / `MODAL_MIN_HEIGHT` (300), never exceeding the modal's declared `width`. Pass higher values when a modal's content stops making sense below a given size - every resizable modal should have a floor that still looks right.
- Sizes are clamped to 95% of the viewport both at drag time and at read time, so a modal sized on a large display still opens sanely on a laptop.
- `ModalResizeGrip` renders the bottom-right grip; double-clicking it forgets the remembered size and returns the modal to its declared default.

`resizeKey` must be stable across renders - it is the persistence key, not a label.

### Modals Opened From Inside the Main Panel

A modal rendered from a component that lives inside the Main Panel (file
preview renderers, terminal views, chat surfaces) MUST pass `portal` to
`<Modal>`:

```tsx
<Modal theme={theme} title="Row 1" priority={MODAL_PRIORITIES.CSV_ROW_DETAIL} portal>
```

`MainPanel.tsx` wraps the session view in `isolate` (`isolation: isolate`),
which creates a stacking context. A `fixed inset-0` backdrop rendered inside
that subtree is still full-viewport in size, but its `z-index: 9999` only ranks
it _within_ MainPanel's context. The Left Bar (`SessionList.tsx`, `relative
z-20`) and the Right Panel (later in DOM order) are siblings of that context, so
they paint on top: the center dims while both side panels stay fully lit, and
the modal looks clipped to the middle of the window.

No z-index fixes this - ranking never crosses a stacking context. Rendering into
`document.body` is the only escape, which is what `portal` does. Most modals
mount at the App root already and don't need it, which is why it is opt-in.

Because jsdom has no layout engine, a test asserting `toBeInTheDocument()`
passes whether or not the modal escaped. Assert it is **not** a descendant of
its host subtree instead:

```tsx
expect(container.querySelector('.csv-table-renderer')).not.toContainElement(modal);
expect(modal.parentElement).toBe(document.body);
```

React context flows through portals, so `useModalLayer` registration, Escape
handling, and theming are unaffected by the relocation.

### Resizable Textareas

Any textarea with a native `resize-y` grip should remember the height the user drags it to. A size someone picked by hand is a preference, so snapping back to the default on the next open (or the next app launch) is a bug, not a reset.

```tsx
const resize = useResizableTextarea({
	sizeKey: 'settings-conductor-profile', // stable, unique
	minHeight: 100, // floor for a remembered height
});

<textarea
	ref={resize.textareaRef}
	className="... resize-y"
	style={{ borderColor: theme.colors.border, minHeight: '100px', ...resize.style }}
/>;
```

How it works:

- `useResizableTextarea` (`src/renderer/hooks/ui/useResizableTextarea.ts`) observes the element and persists the dragged height, debounced. Heights live in one `textareaHeights` map in `settingsStore`, keyed by `sizeKey`, written through to settings and hydrated by `loadAllSettings` on startup.
- The native grip writes the dragged height onto the element's inline `style.height` - the same property the hook writes when restoring one. The observer just compares the current inline height against the last applied height, so a user drag is the only thing it can see (content, font size and viewport width never move an explicit height).
- Omit `defaultHeight` to leave the textarea at whatever its `rows` / CSS `min-height` already give it until the user resizes it. Pass one only when the textarea has no natural size worth keeping.
- `minHeight` / `maxHeight` bound what can be remembered; heights are also clamped to the viewport at read time, so a textarea sized on a large display still opens sanely on a laptop.
- Spread `resize.style` LAST in the `style` prop, after the caller's own `minHeight`, or the inline height gets overwritten.
- Pass `externalRef` when the component already owns a ref on the textarea (autocomplete, focus-on-open). Do NOT add a second ref or a second `ResizeObserver`.

### Auto-Growing Composers

A composer textarea that grows with its content (AI composer, both wizard composers, group chat, feedback chat) uses `useAutosizeTextarea` (`src/renderer/hooks/ui/useAutosizeTextarea.ts`). Do NOT hand-roll the two-line `height = 'auto'` / `height = scrollHeight` pair again.

```tsx
useAutosizeTextarea({ textareaRef: inputRef, value: inputValue, maxHeight: 112 });
```

Why the hand-rolled version is wrong: setting `height = 'auto'` momentarily removes the overflow, which collapses the internal scroll to the top. Once the composer is full and scrolling, every keystroke therefore scrolled the line being typed back out of sight - the text was there, but the last line was clipped until the user scrolled by hand, and the next key hid it again. `resizeTextareaToContent` (`src/renderer/utils/textareaSizing.ts`) restores `scrollTop` across the toggle, and the hook re-pins the view to the bottom when the edit happened at the end of the text (`shouldScrollTextareaToEnd`), so typing, dictation, and paste all keep the caret visible.

Run it on the committed `value`, not inside `onChange`. An `onChange`/`onInput` resize never fires for programmatic edits - voice dictation, draft restore, template insertion - so those grow the text without growing the box.

- `resetKey` forces a re-measure when the value did not change but the content did (switching AI tabs restores a different draft).
- `deferredResizeRef` is for the one caller that owns its own rAF resize on the keystroke path (`useInputAreaTextChange`); while it is true the hook skips both the resize and the scroll so the two cannot race. Everything else omits it.
- `useInputAreaAutosize` is just the AI composer's binding over this hook. Distinct from `useResizableTextarea` above, which remembers a height the USER dragged; pick by who decides the height.

### Escape Key Flow

1. `LayerStackProvider` attaches a **capture-phase** `keydown` listener on `window`.
2. On Escape, it calls `closeTopLayer()` on the stack.
3. `closeTopLayer` checks `onBeforeClose` for dirty modals, then calls the top layer's `onEscape` handler from the handler ref map.
4. The handler ref map (`handlerRefs`) is updated via `updateLayerHandler` without re-sorting the stack - this is a performance optimization.

### Querying the Stack

Components that need to know whether modals are open (for example, to suppress global shortcuts) use `LayerStackAPI`:

```tsx
const { hasOpenLayers, hasOpenModal, layerCount } = useLayerStack();

// hasOpenLayers() - any layer (modal or overlay) is registered
// hasOpenModal()  - at least one 'modal' type layer is registered
```

### Debug API

In development mode, `window.__MAESTRO_DEBUG__.layers` provides:

- `list()` - print all layers in a table
- `top()` - log the topmost layer
- `simulate.escape()` - dispatch an Escape event
- `simulate.closeAll()` - clear the entire stack

### Every Modal Needs a Graphical Exit (`<EscCloseButton>`)

**Rule:** a modal, palette, or find bar must always be dismissable with the pointer alone. Escape is not enough: remote desktop sessions swallow it, tablets driving the web interface have no key to send, and a keyboard-only exit reads as "stuck" to the user.

The `ESC` pill is that exit. Use `<EscCloseButton>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/EscCloseButton.tsx`) - do NOT hand-roll the `px-2 py-0.5 rounded text-xs font-bold` pill again. It was previously copy-pasted as an inert `<div>` (three of them with `pointer-events-none`) in nine places, so every one of those surfaces advertised an exit that did nothing on click.

```tsx
// Header pill, sitting in the search row
<EscCloseButton theme={theme} onClose={onClose} />

// Adornment pill, absolutely positioned inside a `relative` input wrapper
<EscCloseButton
	theme={theme}
	variant="adornment"
	label="Close filter (Esc)"
	onClose={handleFilterEscape}
/>
```

`onClose` must do **exactly** what pressing Escape does. When the Escape path lives in a `useModalLayer` / `registerLayer` callback, extract it into a named `useCallback` and pass the same function to both, rather than duplicating the body (see `TerminalOutput`'s `closeOutputSearch` and `QuickActionsModal`'s `handleEscape`).

Tests: query the pill by role, not by index. It is a real `<button>` now, so `getAllByRole('button')[n]` in a modal test counts it - scope list assertions to the rows themselves (e.g. `[data-action-label]`).

### Segmented Toolbars (`<SegmentedControl>`)

A horizontal row of mutually exclusive options rendered as one joined pill bar - the "Sort by: [Name][Created][Queries]" control above a grid or chart. Use `<SegmentedControl>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/SegmentedControl.tsx`), not a hand-rolled `.map()` over buttons with `borderLeft` seams.

```tsx
<SegmentedControl
	value={sortMode}
	onChange={setSortMode}
	options={[
		{ value: 'name', label: 'Name' },
		{ value: 'queries', label: 'Queries', title: 'Most queries first' },
	]}
	theme={theme}
	ariaLabel="Sort agents"
	testId="agent-overview-sort"
/>
```

It owns the active-segment coloring, the seam borders, `role="radiogroup"` + `role="radio"` semantics, arrow-key navigation between segments, and a single tab stop (`tabIndex` follows the selection, as a native radio group does). Each segment gets `data-testid="${testId}-${value}"`, so existing per-segment test ids keep working when a hand-rolled bar is migrated.

**This is not `<RadioGroup>`.** That primitive renders the same semantics as stacked, description-carrying list rows for settings panes. `SegmentedControl` is the compact toolbar form for short labels where vertical space is scarce. Pick by layout, and do not add a `variant` prop to either one to cover the other.

### Sortable Table Headers (`<SortableTh>` + `useTableSort`)

A table whose column headers sort it needs two pieces, and both live in shared code: `useTableSort()` (`src/renderer/hooks/ui/useTableSort.ts`) for the state, `<SortableTh>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/SortableTh.tsx`) for the header cell.

```tsx
const { sortKey, direction, isDescending, toggleSort } = useTableSort<TaskSortKey>('next', {
	// Text columns read best A-Z, magnitude columns biggest-first.
	defaultDirectionFor: (key) => (key === 'occurrences' ? 'desc' : 'asc'),
});

<SortableTh
	columnKey="next"
	label="Next"
	sortKey={sortKey}
	direction={direction}
	onSort={toggleSort}
	theme={theme}
	align="right"
	title="Sort by time until the next fire"
	className="pb-2 font-medium text-right"
	testId="scheduled-tasks-sort-next"
/>;
```

The hook owns the one rule every hand-rolled copy gets subtly different: clicking the **active** column flips its direction, clicking a **different** column jumps to that column's own default direction. Inheriting the previous column's direction is the bug worth avoiding - going from "Next ascending" to "Occurrences ascending" silently shows the least-used rows first, which reads as broken data rather than as a sort.

The component owns three things:

- **A real `<button>` as the click target.** A `<th role="button" onClick>` announces as a button but has no tab stop and no Enter/Space handling, so it is unreachable by keyboard. `role` grants the semantics without granting the behavior.
- **`aria-sort` on the `<th>`**, never on the inner control, and only the active column carries a direction.
- **A stable indicator slot.** The caret is always laid out and merely transparent when inactive, so switching columns doesn't reflow the header row.

Callers keep their own comparator and own padding/border classes via `className` / `style`. One nuance worth copying: rows whose sort value is genuinely unknown (a Cue interval task has no projected next fire) should be pinned last in **both** directions rather than flowing through the comparator - "unknown" is not "the largest value", and flipping the sort must not promote rows that have nothing to compare.

### Paginating an In-Memory List (`usePagination` + `<Pager>`)

Two unrelated pagination systems live in this codebase; picking the wrong one is the mistake to avoid.

- `useHistoryPagination` (`hooks/history/`) is an **async, IPC-backed windowing engine**. Use it when the data arrives page by page over IPC and the total lives in a database.
- `usePagination` (`hooks/ui/usePagination.ts`) is for a list you **already hold in memory** and simply cannot render all at once. Pure page arithmetic lives in `utils/pagination.ts` so it can be tested without a DOM.

```tsx
const pager = usePagination(sortedRows, 32, `${filterMode}:${sortMode}`);
...
{pager.isPaginated && (
	<Pager
		theme={theme} page={pager.page} totalPages={pager.totalPages}
		onPrev={pager.prevPage} onNext={pager.nextPage}
		canGoPrev={pager.canGoPrev} canGoNext={pager.canGoNext}
	/>
)}
{pager.pageItems.map(renderRow)}
```

Two rules the hook exists to enforce:

**The current page is clamped on read, not in an effect.** A list can shrink underneath an active page - narrowing the tab breakdown from "All" (1236 rows, page 30) to "Open" (18 rows) is the canonical case. Clamping in an effect renders one frame of the out-of-range page first, which flashes an empty grid; clamping on read means the out-of-range state is never visible. `page`, `pageItems`, and `range` are all derived from the clamped value.

**Pass a `resetKey`.** Build it from everything the user can change that reorders or refilters the list (sort mode, filter mode, search text). Without it, re-sorting leaves the user on page 7 of a brand-new ordering, which is an arbitrary slice of data they did not ask for.

**Put `<Pager>` in the toolbar row, not under the list.** A pager below a long grid inside a scrolling modal forces the user to scroll to the bottom, click, and then scroll back to the top to see the page they asked for. Beside the filter and sort controls, everything that changes what you see sits in one place and stays on screen. Gate it on `pager.isPaginated` so the control is absent entirely when everything fits - and choose a page size that keeps the bounded filters on one page, so the pager appears exactly when it is needed.

### Measuring an Element's Width (`useElementWidth`)

`useElementWidth(ref, enabled?)` (`hooks/ui/useElementWidth.ts`) wraps the ResizeObserver boilerplate that was previously inline in `UsageDashboardModal`. Reach for it **only when the number has to exist in JavaScript**: an inline SVG chart needs real pixels for its viewBox, and a responsive breakpoint that switches column counts needs a value to compare. Anything expressible in CSS stays in CSS.

It returns `0` until the first measurement lands, so gate width-dependent children on `width > 0` (or supply a sensible fallback) rather than painting a zero-width chart on the first frame. It also no-ops when `ResizeObserver` is undefined, so jsdom component tests render without a polyfill.

This matters for any resizable modal that draws a chart: a hard-coded SVG width silently stops matching the frame the moment the user drags it.

### Entity Tiles in the Usage Dashboard (`<EntityTile>`)

The Usage Dashboard's card grids (the agent grid in `AgentOverviewCards`, the per-tab grid in `TabBreakdown`) all render the same tile: status dot, truncating title, badges, corner age, optional subtitle, a row of labeled stats, and a corner sparkline. That chrome lives once in `src/renderer/components/UsageDashboard/EntityTile.tsx` - border states (default / dashed / hovered / selected), the staggered `card-enter` animation, the clickable-button affordance, and the highlighted-stat accent coloring.

Adding a new dashboard grid means shaping data into `EntityTileStat[]` and passing it, not re-deriving 150 lines of tile styling. `EntityTile` is presentational: it takes formatted strings and colors and reports clicks, so callers keep their own sort/filter state and their own number formatting.

It deliberately lives under `UsageDashboard/` rather than in `renderer/widgets/`: widgets are barred from importing from `UsageDashboard/`, and this tile is an entity summary (many stats, one subject) rather than the widget library's `StatCard` (one headline metric).

### Turn Attribution Pills (`<TurnSettingPills>`)

Each assistant message in the AI transcript carries a centered footer row naming the configuration that produced it: the Claude token-source pill (`claude -p` / `TUI Wrapper`, from `getTokenSourcePill()`), then the model and effort the turn was SENT with. `src/renderer/components/ui/TurnSettingPills.tsx` renders the model/effort half - static badges that mirror the composer's interactive `ModelEffortPills` (Sparkles + accent for model, Gauge + warning for effort), because a finished turn's configuration is a fact, not a control.

The values come from `LogEntry.turnModel` / `turnEffort`, copied in `useBatchedSessionUpdates` from the tab's send-time stamp (`AITab.turnModel` / `turnEffort`, written by `codifyTurnSettings()` in `utils/providerTabSessions.ts`). Read the stamp, never the live tab or agent value: settings are codified at send, so a model change made while a turn streams applies to the next message and must not relabel the response already running. An unset value means the agent's own default applied, and that pill is omitted rather than labeled with a guess.

Two traps when touching this row:

- `collapsedLogs` in `TerminalOutput` merges consecutive non-user entries into one rendered entry built from `[0]`. A group can lead with a system banner that carries no stamp, so the merge lifts `turnModel` / `turnEffort` from the first grouped entry that has them - the same fix `renderStyle` needed.
- `LogItem`'s memo comparator lists every field that affects rendering. A new pill field that is not in that list will not repaint when it changes.

### Text Selection in Modals

**Rule:** any modal (or modal subtree) whose primary purpose is _clicking_ - buttons, tabs, list rows, cards, graph nodes, filter chips, toggles, dropdowns - must have `select-none` on its root container. The dashboard-style modals (Cue, Usage Dashboard, Symphony, Playbook Exchange, Settings, Director's Notes list) are all click-driven; native browser drag-to-select highlighting fires accidentally during normal interactions (clicking a tab, dragging a graph node, double-clicking a card) and looks broken.

```tsx
// Click-driven modal: kill text selection at the root
<div className="relative rounded-xl shadow-2xl flex flex-col select-none">...</div>
```

`select-none` cascades through descendants but Chromium preserves native selection behavior inside `<input>` and `<textarea>`, so search fields and form controls keep working without intervention.

**Carve out content subtrees with `select-text`** when the modal contains regions where copying matters: prose detail views, code/YAML editors, log entry bodies, error messages, file paths, AI chat output. Apply `select-text` directly on the root of that subtree - it overrides the ancestor's `select-none`.

```tsx
// Detail view nested inside a select-none parent: opt back in
<div className="rounded-lg border shadow-2xl flex flex-col select-text">...</div>
```

**Skip modals whose primary purpose is reading or editing text:** `CueYamlEditor`, `CueHelpModal`, the wizard chat shell's message bubbles, Director's Notes detail popup, the System Log Viewer (intentionally left selectable), confirmation dialogs with error text. If the user's main interaction is reading or copying, leave selection alone.

**When adding a new modal,** decide first whether it's click-driven or content-driven. If click-driven, add `select-none` to the root in the same commit as the modal itself - retrofitting it later requires hunting down every nested detail view to add `select-text` overrides.

## Theme System

### Architecture

```text
src/shared/theme-types.ts   - Type definitions (ThemeId, ThemeColors, Theme)
src/shared/themes.ts        - Canonical theme objects (THEMES record)
src/renderer/constants/themes.ts - Re-exports for renderer imports
```

### Theme Structure

Each theme has:

```typescript
interface Theme {
	id: ThemeId;
	name: string;
	mode: ThemeMode; // 'light' | 'dark' | 'vibe'
	colors: ThemeColors;
}
```

`ThemeColors` fields (13 color slots):

| Color              | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `bgMain`           | Main content area background                |
| `bgSidebar`        | Left/right sidebar background               |
| `bgActivity`       | Interactive/hover element backgrounds       |
| `border`           | Dividers and outlines                       |
| `textMain`         | Primary text                                |
| `textDim`          | Secondary/muted text                        |
| `accent`           | Highlights and interactive elements         |
| `accentDim`        | Dimmed accent (typically with alpha)        |
| `accentText`       | Text in accent contexts                     |
| `accentForeground` | Text ON accent backgrounds (contrast color) |
| `success`          | Green states                                |
| `warning`          | Yellow/orange states                        |
| `error`            | Red states                                  |

`ThemeColors` also has optional ANSI 16-color terminal fields (`ansiBlack`, `ansiRed`, `ansiGreen`, `ansiYellow`, `ansiBlue`, `ansiMagenta`, `ansiCyan`, `ansiWhite`, and their `ansiBright*` variants). When not provided, `XTerminal` uses theme-appropriate defaults.

### Available Themes

Three modes with built-in themes:

**Dark**: dracula, monokai, nord, tokyo-night, catppuccin-mocha, gruvbox-dark, solarized-dark

**Light**: github-light, solarized-light, one-light, gruvbox-light, catppuccin-latte, ayu-light

**Vibe**: pedurple, maestros-choice, dre-synth, inquest

Plus `custom` - user-defined via Custom Theme Builder.

### Using Themes in Components

All themed components receive a `theme: Theme` prop. Apply colors via inline styles:

```tsx
<div
	style={{
		backgroundColor: theme.colors.bgSidebar,
		borderColor: theme.colors.border,
		color: theme.colors.textMain,
	}}
>
	<span style={{ color: theme.colors.textDim }}>Secondary text</span>
</div>
```

### Setting the Active Theme

Via `useSettings` hook:

```tsx
const { activeThemeId, setActiveThemeId } = useSettings();
setActiveThemeId('tokyo-night');
```

Custom theme colors are managed through `customThemeColors` / `setCustomThemeColors` / `customThemeBaseId`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Architecture

```text
src/renderer/constants/shortcuts.ts                 - Shortcut definitions
src/renderer/hooks/keyboard/useMainKeyboardHandler.ts - Global keydown handler
src/renderer/hooks/keyboard/useKeyboardShortcutHelpers.ts - Shortcut matching
src/renderer/components/ShortcutEditor.tsx           - User customization UI
src/renderer/components/ShortcutsHelpModal.tsx       - Help overlay (Cmd+/)
```

### Shortcut Categories

Three categories defined in `src/renderer/constants/shortcuts.ts`:

**DEFAULT_SHORTCUTS** - Editable by the user:

- Navigation: `Cmd+[`/`]` (cycle agents), `Cmd+Shift+,`/`.` (nav back/forward)
- Panels: `Alt+Cmd+ArrowLeft/Right` (toggle sidebars)
- Actions: `Cmd+K` (quick actions), `Cmd+,` (settings), `Cmd+N` (new agent)
- Views: `Cmd+Shift+D` (git diff), `Cmd+Shift+G` (git log), `Cmd+Shift+E` (auto run expanded)
- Focus: `Cmd+.` (toggle input/output), `Cmd+Shift+A` (focus left panel)

**FIXED_SHORTCUTS** - Displayed in help but not configurable:

- `Alt+Cmd+1-0` (jump to agent 1-10)
- `Cmd+F` (context-sensitive filter/search)
- `Cmd+ArrowLeft/Right` (file preview navigation)
- `Cmd+=`/`Cmd+-` (font size)

**TAB_SHORTCUTS** - AI mode tab management:

- `Cmd+T` (new tab), `Cmd+W` (close tab), `Cmd+1-9` (go to tab N)
- `Alt+Cmd+T` (tab switcher), `Cmd+Shift+T` (reopen closed tab)
- `Cmd+R` (toggle read-only), `Cmd+S` (toggle save to history)

### Keyboard Handler Pattern

The main handler in `useMainKeyboardHandler` uses a **ref pattern** for performance. Instead of listing 50+ state values as `useEffect` dependencies (causing listener churn), a single ref holds all context:

```tsx
// In the hook:
const keyboardHandlerRef = useRef<KeyboardHandlerContext | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
	const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
		const ctx = keyboardHandlerRef.current;
		if (!ctx) return;
		// use ctx.isShortcut, ctx.sessions, etc.
	};
	window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
	return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
}, []); // empty deps - handler reads from ref

// In App.tsx render body:
keyboardHandlerRef.current = { isShortcut, sessions, activeSession, ... };
```

### Shortcut Customization

Users can rebind `DEFAULT_SHORTCUTS` and `TAB_SHORTCUTS` via the ShortcutEditor in Settings. Custom bindings are persisted through `useSettings`:

```tsx
const { shortcuts, setShortcuts, tabShortcuts, setTabShortcuts } = useSettings();
```

### Keyboard Mastery Gamification

Shortcut usage is tracked for a gamification system (`keyboardMasteryStats`). The `recordShortcutUsage` function in settings increments counters and can trigger level-up celebrations.

## Notification System (Toast)

Toasts use the **same five-color design language** as Center Flash (`green | yellow | orange | red | theme`) so the two systems feel unified. The difference is durability: toasts queue, sit in the corner, and stay until the user (or a timer) dismisses them; Center Flashes are exclusive, momentary, and center-screen.

### Architecture

```text
src/renderer/stores/notificationStore.ts - Zustand store + notifyToast()
src/renderer/components/Toast.tsx        - ToastContainer + ToastItem
src/cli/commands/notify-toast.ts         - `maestro-cli notify toast` command (external trigger)
```

### Firing a Toast (in-app)

Use `notifyToast()` from anywhere (React or non-React code):

```typescript
import { notifyToast } from '../stores/notificationStore';

notifyToast({
	color: 'theme', // 'green' | 'yellow' | 'orange' | 'red' | 'theme' (default)
	title: 'Task Complete',
	message: 'Auto Run finished phase-01.md',
	// Optional fields:
	dismissible: false, // true = sticky, no auto-dismiss, click X to close
	duration: 20000, // ms; ignored when dismissible:true
	group: 'Backend',
	project: 'My Agent',
	taskDuration: 45000,
	tabName: 'main',
	sessionId: 'abc-123', // enables click-to-navigate
	tabId: 'tab-1',
	actionUrl: 'https://github.com/pr/1',
	actionLabel: 'View PR',
});
```

`notifyToast` handles:

1. ID generation and timestamp
2. Color resolution (color > legacy type > 'theme')
3. Duration calculation (config seconds → ms; sticky when `dismissible: true`)
4. Adding to visible queue (unless toasts disabled with `defaultDuration: -1`)
5. Logging via `window.maestro.logger.toast`
6. Audio feedback via `window.maestro.notification.speak` (if enabled)
7. OS desktop notification via `window.maestro.notification.show` (if enabled)
8. Auto-dismiss timer (skipped for dismissible toasts)

### Firing a Toast (external - `maestro-cli`)

```bash
# Default - themed, auto-dismisses on the app's default schedule.
maestro-cli notify toast "Build" "Build succeeded on main"

# Pick a color and a custom duration.
maestro-cli notify toast "Tests" "All green" --color green --timeout 10
maestro-cli notify toast "Quota" "Approaching limit" --color orange --timeout 30

# Sticky - user must click to dismiss. Cannot combine with --timeout.
maestro-cli notify toast "Action required" "Approve the PR before EOD" \
    --color red --dismissible
```

`--dismissible` is the **only** way external scripts can leave a toast on screen indefinitely. `--timeout 0` is rejected - use `--dismissible` instead. Numeric durations are capped at **60 seconds** (toasts are corner-only and less obtrusive than Center Flash, so the cap is more generous than 5 s).

### Toast vs Center Flash: when each fits

| Scenario                                                        | Pick this                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| User-initiated micro-confirmation ("Copied", "Saved")           | Center Flash                         |
| Async result with context (PR posted, export complete)          | Toast                                |
| Critical message the user **must** acknowledge                  | Toast `dismissible: true`            |
| Quick mode-toggle indicator                                     | Center Flash                         |
| Click-to-navigate to a session/tab                              | Toast (Center Flash isn't clickable) |
| Long-form message the user might want to re-read after a moment | Toast                                |

### Color palette (shared with Center Flash)

| Color    | Source                          | Toast use cases                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme`  | `theme.colors.accent`           | **Default.** Generic notifications with no semantic      |
| `green`  | `theme.colors.success`          | Success / completion ("Build succeeded", "Tests pass")   |
| `yellow` | `theme.colors.warning`          | Soft heads-up ("Approaching context window limit")       |
| `orange` | Fixed `#f97316` (no theme slot) | Emphatic warning ("Quota at 90%")                        |
| `red`    | `theme.colors.error`            | Failure / blocking issue ("Sync failed", "Auth expired") |

Same icons as Center Flash: green→Check, yellow→Info, orange→AlertTriangle, red→AlertCircle, theme→Sparkles. **Do not** add a sixth color - keep the design language consistent across both systems.

### Dismissible toasts

Set `dismissible: true` (or pass `--dismissible` from the CLI) when the toast is something the user **must** see - a critical error, a required action, a security alert, etc. Behavior:

- No auto-dismiss timer is set.
- The progress bar is hidden.
- The close button is rendered with the toast's accent color (filled background + ring) instead of the muted `textDim` it gets for auto-dismissing toasts. This signals "you need to click this."
- `aria-label` becomes "Dismiss notification" for screen readers.
- `dismissible` is mutually exclusive with `duration` / `--timeout` (the CLI rejects the combination; in-app, `dismissible: true` overrides any `duration` value).

Use sparingly - every dismissible toast is a tiny piece of homework for the user.

### Toast Configuration

Managed through the notification store:

```typescript
const store = useNotificationStore();

store.setDefaultDuration(20); // seconds; 0 = never dismiss; -1 = disable toasts
store.setAudioFeedback(true, 'say'); // enable TTS with command
store.setOsNotifications(true); // enable OS notifications
```

### Non-React Access

```typescript
import { getNotificationState, getNotificationActions } from '../stores/notificationStore';

const state = getNotificationState();
const actions = getNotificationActions();
actions.clearToasts();
```

### ToastContainer Component

Rendered as a portal to `document.body`, positioned fixed at bottom-right. Each `ToastItem` shows:

- Color-coded icon (resolved from `toast.color` - see palette above)
- Optional group badge, project name, tab name
- Title and message
- Optional action link
- Optional task duration
- Progress bar for auto-dismiss countdown (hidden for `dismissible` toasts)
- Slide-in/out animations
- Close button - emphasized (color-tinted) when `dismissible: true`

### Back-compat: legacy `type` API (in-app only)

The original API used `type: 'success' | 'info' | 'warning' | 'error'`. It is still accepted **in-app** via `notifyToast({ type })` for back-compat, but **deprecated** - new code should use `color`. The CLI flag `--type` was removed. Mapping:

| Legacy type | Maps to color |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| `success`   | `green`       |
| `info`      | `theme`       |
| `warning`   | `yellow`      |
| `error`     | `red`         |

Existing in-app callers using `type:` continue to work without changes.

## Above-Modal Layering (`Z_LAYERS`)

Ordinary modals use plain Tailwind classes: `z-[9999]` for the backdrop, `z-[10000]`/`z-[10001]` for menus and tooltips anchored inside one. Those numbers only ever compete with each other, so they stay inline.

The handful of overlays that deliberately outrank a modal read their value from `Z_LAYERS` in `src/renderer/constants/zLayers.ts`. Their relative order is a product decision, so it lives in one file instead of being rediscovered as a magic number per component:

| Layer                    | Surface                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Z_LAYERS.CONFETTI`      | Celebration particles - decorative, sits under real UI          |
| `Z_LAYERS.TOAST`         | `ToastContainer` - visible over modals so results aren't missed |
| `Z_LAYERS.QUICK_ACTIONS` | Command palette - owns the screen, including over toasts        |
| `Z_LAYERS.CENTER_FLASH`  | Momentary ack - always the top-most pixel                       |

Do NOT add a new hard-coded five-digit z-index. If a surface needs to sit above a modal, give it an entry here so the ordering stays reviewable. Note that a z-index only ranks within its stacking context: a portal to `document.body` (toasts, center flash) always compares against the root, while an inline overlay compares against its nearest ancestor that establishes a context.

---

## Center Flash System (rapid temporary notifications)

**Center Flash** is the canonical mechanism for momentary, center-screen acknowledgements of user-initiated actions. It is intentionally distinct from the Toast system - they are **not** interchangeable. Use the decision table below; do not hand-roll a new flash component.

The Center Flash visual is **themed** - every Maestro theme produces a visually distinct flash by default. The card uses the active theme's `bgSidebar` with an accent-tinted overlay; the icon, border, and glow take the resolved color (default: `theme.colors.accent`).

### Decision: Center Flash vs Toast

| You want to...                                                                 | Use                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Confirm a _user-initiated_ action they just took ("Copied", "Saved", "Pinned") | **Center Flash** (default `theme` color)         |
| Surface an _async_ result tied to context (PR posted, export complete, etc.)   | Toast                                            |
| Report an error or failure                                                     | Toast (persistent, dismissable, has icon + body) |
| Show a brief mode-switch indicator ("Bionify: ON")                             | Center Flash (`theme` color)                     |
| Warn the user about something they should read ("Commands disabled")           | Center Flash (`yellow` or `orange` color)        |
| Anything that the user might want to click, navigate from, or dismiss manually | Toast                                            |

**Litmus test:** if the message would still be useful 10 seconds from now, it is a Toast. If the user only needs to see "yep, that happened" before getting on with their work, it is a Center Flash.

### Architecture

```text
src/renderer/stores/centerFlashStore.ts  - Zustand store + notifyCenterFlash() / dismissCenterFlash()
src/renderer/components/CenterFlash/     - <CenterFlash /> component (mounted once in App.tsx via portal)
src/renderer/utils/flashCopiedToClipboard.ts - clipboard-ack helper
src/cli/commands/notify-flash.ts         - `maestro-cli notify flash` command (external trigger)
```

Center Flash is **exclusive** - only one is visible at a time. A new flash replaces the previous one (no queue). The component is mounted once in `App.tsx` next to `<ToastContainer />`; do not mount it locally inside features.

### Firing a flash (in-app)

```typescript
import { notifyCenterFlash } from '../stores/centerFlashStore';

notifyCenterFlash({
	message: 'File Saved', // required, primary line
	detail: '/path/to/file.md', // optional second line, mono font, truncates with title attr
	color: 'theme', // default; matches the active theme. See "Color palette" below.
	duration: 1500, // optional ms; default 1500; 0 = no auto-dismiss
});
```

Convenience helper for the most common case (clipboard acks - always defaults to `color: 'theme'`):

```typescript
import { flashCopiedToClipboard } from '../utils/flashCopiedToClipboard';

flashCopiedToClipboard(value); // "Copied to Clipboard" + value as detail
flashCopiedToClipboard(value, 'Session ID Copied'); // custom title
```

**Always** prefer `flashCopiedToClipboard` for clipboard-success acks so wording, color, and duration stay consistent across the app.

### Firing a flash (external - `maestro-cli`)

```bash
# Default - themed, matches the active Maestro theme. Auto-dismisses after 1.5 s.
maestro-cli notify flash "Build complete"

# Pick an explicit color. One of: green, yellow, orange, red, theme.
maestro-cli notify flash "Tests passed" --color green
maestro-cli notify flash "Production deploy starting" --color orange --detail "v1.42.0"

# Control how long it stays. --timeout is in seconds (max 5).
maestro-cli notify flash "CI failed on main" --color red --timeout 5
```

External integrations should pass `--color` (one of the 5 canonical values) so the flash visibly matches their intent without depending on the user's theme.

**Duration cap:** CLI-triggered flashes are capped at **5 seconds**. The cap is enforced both client-side (CLI rejects values above the limit before sending) and at the IPC boundary in the main process (rejects oversized payloads from any external client). The cap exists so external scripts can't stick a permanent overlay on the user. Internal in-app callers using `notifyCenterFlash()` directly are not capped.

### Color palette (the design language)

These five colors are the **only** colors the Center Flash will ever render. They are deliberately limited so the visual language stays consistent and instantly recognizable across the app and across CLI integrations.

| Color    | Source                          | Icon            | Use for                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme`  | `theme.colors.accent`           | `Sparkles`      | **Default.** Themed acknowledgement with no semantic - clipboard acks, mode toggles, quiet confirmations |
| `green`  | `theme.colors.success`          | `Check`         | Explicit success semantic when the user benefits from "yes it worked" coloring (CLI status, test passes) |
| `yellow` | `theme.colors.warning`          | `Info`          | Soft heads-up, not a failure ("Commands disabled", "No unread tabs")                                     |
| `orange` | Fixed `#f97316` (no theme slot) | `AlertTriangle` | More emphatic warning than yellow ("Production deploy starting", "Quota at 90%")                         |
| `red`    | `theme.colors.error`            | `AlertCircle`   | Failure / blocking outcome from a CLI or external trigger (in-app failures usually go to Toast instead)  |

**Why these five?** They cover the full traffic-light range (green → yellow → orange → red) plus a neutral themed default. Adding a sixth color would dilute their meaning. If a use case does not fit, it is probably a Toast, an inline banner, or a modal.

### Visual treatment (do not override)

The component implements one consistent treatment that adapts to color and theme. Do not attempt to restyle it:

- **Themed frosted glass card.** Background = `theme.colors.bgSidebar` + a 135° linear gradient overlay tinted with the resolved color (slightly stronger for `theme` so the theme accent reads clearly). `backdrop-filter: blur(16px) saturate(160%)`.
- **Color-tinted accents.** Icon color, icon's tinted circle, card border, and outer glow all use the resolved color. Each Maestro theme therefore produces a visually distinct flash for the same color value.
- **Color icons** (lucide): see Color palette table. Icon sits in a 36 px tinted circle (`color * 26%` bg, `color * 33%` inner ring).
- **Two-line layout when `detail` is provided.** Semibold title (`textMain`) on top, mono `textDim` detail below (truncated, full value on hover via `title=`).
- **Bottom progress bar** animates from full width to zero over `duration` using the resolved color at 85% opacity.
- **Entrance:** 180 ms scale (0.94 → 1) + fade. **Exit:** 160 ms reverse. No bounce, no spring, no drop-and-fade.
- **Z-index:** `100001` (sits above toasts, below modal-stack overlays). `pointer-events: none` (never blocks input).
- **Theme tokens used:** `bgSidebar`, `textMain`, `textDim`, `border`, plus the resolved color (one of `success`, `warning`, `accent`, `error`, or the fixed orange). No new color tokens needed for flash usage.
- **A11y:** `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-atomic="true"`. Do not add a close button - flashes are not interactive.

### Duration guidance

- **Default 1500 ms** is correct for almost everything. Do not pass `duration` unless you have a specific reason.
- Use a longer duration (`2500`-`3000`) only for `yellow`/`orange`/`red` flashes with longer messages the user must read.
- Use `duration: 0` (no auto-dismiss) only for the rarest cases - it requires you to call `dismissCenterFlash()` explicitly later, and Center Flash is exclusive, so a non-dismissed flash blocks every subsequent one. **Note:** `0` is rejected for externally-triggered flashes (CLI / web). External callers are also capped at 5000 ms.

### Anti-patterns (do not do these)

- ❌ **Do not** create a new center-screen overlay component. Use `notifyCenterFlash`.
- ❌ **Do not** roll your own `useState` + `setTimeout` for clipboard acks. Use `flashCopiedToClipboard`.
- ❌ **Do not** use `notifyToast` for clipboard-success acks. Use `flashCopiedToClipboard`.
- ❌ **Do not** add a sixth color or override the visual treatment. The five-color palette is the design language - extending it would defeat the purpose.
- ❌ **Do not** add `flashNotification` / `successFlashNotification` state to a store. The legacy `setFlashNotification` and `setSuccessFlashNotification` setters in `uiStore` are compatibility shims that delegate to `notifyCenterFlash`; do not extend them - call `notifyCenterFlash` directly in new code.
- ❌ **Do not** stack flashes (queue them). The system is intentionally exclusive; the latest flash wins.

### Back-compat: legacy `variant` API (in-app only)

The original API used `variant: 'success' | 'info' | 'warning' | 'error'`. It is still accepted **in-app** via `notifyCenterFlash({ variant })` for back-compat, but **deprecated** - new code should use `color`. The CLI flag `--variant` was removed. The mapping is fixed:

| Legacy variant | Maps to color |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| `success`      | `green`       |
| `info`         | `theme`       |
| `warning`      | `yellow`      |
| `error`        | `red`         |

Pre-existing call sites using `setFlashNotification` / `setSuccessFlashNotification` (via `uiStore` or via `showFlashNotification` / `showSuccessFlash` in `useAgentExecution`) continue to work - they fire `notifyCenterFlash` with `color: 'yellow'` and `color: 'theme'` respectively under the hood.

---

## Shared Components

### `<Modal>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/Modal.tsx`)

Full-featured modal wrapper. See Modal System section above.

### `<ModalFooter>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/Modal.tsx`)

Standard cancel/confirm button layout:

```tsx
<ModalFooter
	theme={theme}
	onCancel={handleClose}
	onConfirm={handleSubmit}
	confirmLabel="Delete"
	destructive={true} // red confirm button
	confirmDisabled={!canDelete}
	showCancel={true}
/>
```

### `<CornerDot>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/CornerDot.tsx`)

The small pip pinned to the corner of something else: the red unread dot over a
status dot, the accent dot over the Bell filter, the pulsing dot over the Group
Chats count badge. Render it inside a `relative` parent. Do NOT hand-roll
another `absolute -top-0.5 -right-0.5 w-1.5 h-1.5 rounded-full` - there were
four copies and they had already drifted on size and offset.

```tsx
<div className="relative">
	<StatusDot />
	{hasUnread && <CornerDot color={theme.colors.error} title="Unread messages" />}
</div>
```

- `size` - `'sm'` (6px) over a status dot or small icon, `'md'` (8px) to read against a filled badge.
- `placement` - `'top-right'` (default) or `'right'` for parents too short to have a usable corner.
- `pulse` - live activity. Steady means "waiting for you".
- `ringColor` - pass the surface color (e.g. `theme.colors.bgSidebar`) when the dot sits on a filled parent.
- `title` - gives both a hover tooltip and an accessible name. Without one the dot is `aria-hidden`,
  since it usually just repeats what its parent already says. The dot is deliberately NOT
  `pointer-events-none` (that kills the tooltip); clicks bubble to the parent.

### `<FontScaleControl>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/FontScaleControl.tsx`)

Decrease / reset / increase font zoom for a reading pane. Pair it with
`useFontScale(storageKey)` (`src/renderer/hooks/ui/useFontScale.ts`), which owns
the value, the clamping (0.7 - 2.0, rounded to two decimals so no
`calc(0.875rem * 1.0000000000000002)` reaches the DOM) and the localStorage
persistence. Do NOT hand-roll another pair of `AArrowUp` / `AArrowDown` buttons.

```tsx
const fontScale = useFontScale('filePreview.fontScale');
<FontScaleControl theme={theme} control={fontScale} variant="floating" target="preview" />;
```

- `variant="inline"` - bordered squares for a toolbar or stats bar (Director's Notes).
- `variant="floating"` - frosted pill for overlaying a scrolling pane (file preview,
  pinned top-right as the mirror of the Table of Contents button at bottom-right).
- The percentage in the middle appears only once zoomed and doubles as the reset.

**Only render it where the zoom moves type.** A control that changes nothing reads
as broken: Director's Notes hides it in Rich Mode (fixed-size widget chrome), and
the file preview gates it on `canScaleFontForView()` in `filePreviewUtils.ts`
(images, binary card, rendered HTML iframe, Mermaid, CSV / JSONL tables opt out).
Applying the scale is per-surface: prose reads `--fp-font-scale` from the scroll
container, the CM6 panes take a `fontScale` prop that rides in the theme, and the
Fast text tier must scale its fixed virtualizer page height by the same number or
the pages overlap.

### `<FormInput>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/FormInput.tsx`)

Themed form input with label, validation, and Enter-to-submit:

```tsx
<FormInput
	theme={theme}
	label="Agent Name"
	value={name}
	onChange={setName}
	onSubmit={handleSave}
	placeholder="Enter name..."
	error={validationError}
	helperText="Used in the Left Bar"
	monospace={false}
	autoFocus={true}
	selectOnFocus={true}
	addon={<button>Browse</button>}
/>
```

Key features:

- Ref forwarding for focus management
- Built-in Enter key handling with `submitEnabled` guard
- Error state changes border color to `theme.colors.error`
- Auto-generated `id` for label association (accessibility)

### `<ToggleSwitch>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/ToggleSwitch.tsx`)

The themed pill toggle. Use it instead of hand-rolling the
`relative w-10 h-5 rounded-full` + `translate-x-5` button - that markup was
copy-pasted across the bundled command panels and drifted (some copies lost
`title`, some lost `aria-checked`):

```tsx
<ToggleSwitch
	checked={enabled}
	onChange={onEnabledChange}
	theme={theme}
	ariaLabel="Show Spec Kit commands in slash command autocomplete"
	title={enabled ? 'Hide from slash command autocomplete' : 'Show in slash command autocomplete'}
/>
```

Renders `role="switch"` with `aria-checked`, so tests select it with
`getByRole('switch', { name: ... })`. For a full labeled settings row with icon,
section label, and description, use `<SettingCheckbox>` below instead.

### `<CollapsedCommandsNotice>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/CollapsedCommandsNotice.tsx`)

Placeholder shown in place of a disabled command section's list (Spec Kit,
OpenSpec, BMAD). Turning a section off collapses its commands out of view, but
they stay reachable for editing behind "Show anyway":

```tsx
{
	!enabled && commands.length > 0 && (
		<CollapsedCommandsNotice
			theme={theme}
			count={commands.length}
			expanded={revealWhileDisabled}
			onToggle={() => setRevealWhileDisabled((prev) => !prev)}
			sectionName="Spec Kit"
		/>
	);
}
```

Panels pair it with a `revealWhileDisabled` state that resets in a
`useEffect` on `enabled`, so re-disabling a section always re-collapses the list.

### `<ErrorBoundary>` (`src/renderer/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)

React error boundary that catches render errors, reports to Sentry, and shows a recovery UI:

```tsx
<ErrorBoundary fallbackComponent={<CustomError />} onReset={() => resetState()}>
	<RiskyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

Default fallback shows error details, component stack trace, and "Try Again" / "Reload App" buttons. Reports to Sentry via `Sentry.captureException`.

### `<Markdown>` (`src/renderer/components/Markdown/`)

The single, unified react-markdown renderer for the desktop app. Pick a `preset`
instead of wiring `react-markdown` by hand:

```tsx
import { Markdown } from '../Markdown';

<Markdown preset="document" theme={theme} content={md} onExternalLinkClick={openUrl} />;
```

Presets:

- **`chat`** - richest surface (AI Terminal, Group Chat, History, Feedback,
  Director's Notes, Document Graph). Shiki code fences with copy button + language
  picker, file links via `remarkFileLinks`, right-click link/file/image context
  menus (images and diagrams get their Copy/Save menu app-wide from
  `ImageContextMenuHost`, not from this preset), IPC-loaded local images, chat line
  breaks + KaTeX math, Bionify, raw-HTML + DOMPurify. `MarkdownRenderer` is a thin
  wrapper around `<Markdown preset="chat">`.
- **`document`** - file/doc preview. Prism highlighting, search highlight, anchor
  (`#`) links, pluggable `imageRenderer`, `customLanguageRenderers` (mermaid),
  `extraRemark/RehypePlugins`. Renders bare so callers keep their own scoped prose
  container. Pass `frontmatter={false}` for GFM-only surfaces.
- **`wizard-bubble`** / **`release-notes`** - minimal, tightly-styled presets.

Shared internals (do NOT re-implement): plugin selection lives in
`Markdown/plugins.ts` (`buildMarkdownPlugins`), text preprocessing in
`Markdown/preprocess.ts` (`preprocessMarkdown`, `fixMarkdownLinkSpaces`), and the
leaf renderers in `Markdown/components/*` (`MarkdownLink`, `InlineCode`,
`HexSwatch`, `ShikiCodeBlock`, `PrismCodeBlock`, `LocalImage`). The document
component map is `createMarkdownComponents()` in `utils/markdownConfig.ts`, which
`<Markdown preset="document">` uses internally. A few advanced surfaces (AutoRun's
keystroke-memoized preview, FilePreview's tier selection + from-tree image
resolution, the Wizard DocumentEditor) consume `createMarkdownComponents()`
directly rather than the shell, but share the same leaf implementation.

#### Clickable task checkboxes

react-markdown renders every GFM checkbox `disabled`, so a rendered preview is
read-only by default even though the prose styles give the box a pointer cursor.
Three pieces make one clickable, and they are shared - do NOT rebuild any of
them per surface:

- `rehypeSourceLine` (`components/Markdown/rehypeSourceLine.ts`) in the caller's
  rehype plugins. It stamps each box with the 1-based line its `- [ ]` marker
  lives on. The box itself is synthesized during mdast -> hast and carries no
  position, so it inherits its list item's line.
- `onTaskToggle: (line) => Promise<boolean>` passed to
  `createMarkdownComponents()`. It swaps in `<TaskCheckbox>`
  (`components/Markdown/components/TaskCheckbox.tsx`), which owns the optimistic
  flip; resolve `false` and the box reverts. Omit the option and the read-only
  behavior is unchanged.
- `toggleTaskCheckboxAtLine()` (`utils/markdownTasks.ts`) to rewrite the source.
  It preserves indentation, bullet style, and CRLF endings, and returns `null`
  for a line with no task marker so a stale render cannot corrupt the file.

Do NOT count checkboxes in the DOM and map them onto the Nth task line: that
drifts the moment a `- [ ]` appears inside a code fence. The file preview and
the Auto Run panel both ride this path; Auto Run drops the callback while a
document is locked by a running Auto Run, matching its disabled editor.

**The toggle handler MUST have a stable identity.** `createMarkdownComponents()`
returns a map of freshly-created component functions, so anything that rebuilds
that map hands React a NEW component TYPE for every element and it unmounts and
remounts the whole rendered document - throwing away the reader's scroll
position, restarting images, and re-running Mermaid. A toggle handler naturally
closes over the document content, so an ordinary `useCallback` is reborn on
every edit and does exactly that. Wrap it in `useStableCallback()`
(`hooks/utils/useStableCallback.ts`) and keep the component memo's dependencies
off the content (depend on `file.path`, not `file`). `useAutoRunMarkdown` does
the wrapping internally, so its callers cannot get this wrong.

#### Alert callouts

`[!NOTE]`-style callouts need a plugin AND a blockquote renderer. `remarkAlert`
(`components/Markdown/remarkAlert.ts`) tags the blockquote with
`markdown-alert-<type>`; `alertTypeFromClassName()` reads it back and the
blockquote delegates to `<AlertCallout>`. `<Markdown>` wires both automatically
(`alerts: true`); surfaces that assemble their own remark stack must push
`remarkAlert` right after GFM and before `remark-breaks`, or the marker stays
literal text. Labels, accents, and icon geometry live in
`components/Markdown/alertMeta.ts` so the React callout and the File Preview
Fast tier (which emits HTML strings via `markdownFast/alertTagger.ts`) cannot
drift.

Separate engines, intentionally not part of `<Markdown>`: `MarkdownPreviewFast`
(markdown-it, virtualized for 64KB+ files) and `MobileMarkdownRenderer` (web
bundle, no IPC).

### `<SettingCheckbox>` (`src/renderer/components/SettingCheckbox.tsx`)

Toggle switch with icon, section label, title, and description:

```tsx
<SettingCheckbox
	icon={Bell}
	sectionLabel="Notifications"
	title="OS Notifications"
	description="Show desktop notifications when tasks complete"
	checked={osNotificationsEnabled}
	onChange={setOsNotificationsEnabled}
	theme={theme}
/>
```

### `<ToastContainer>` (`src/renderer/components/Toast.tsx`)

Portal-rendered toast notification stack. Rendered in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
<ToastContainer theme={theme} onSessionClick={handleSessionClick} />
```

### `<EnvVarList>` (`src/renderer/components/ui/EnvVarList.tsx`)

Read-only view of an agent's **effective** environment: the merged result of all
three layers, each row badged with the layer whose value won.

```tsx
<EnvVarList
	theme={theme}
	vars={resolveAgentEnvironment({ global, agent, session })}
	emptyMessage={`No environment variables are set for ${session.name}.`}
	testId="reauth-env"
/>
```

Feed it from `resolveAgentEnvironment()` in `src/shared/agentEnvironment.ts` (see
[SHARED-UTILS.md](SHARED-UTILS.md)) rather than merging the layers at the call
site, or the panel drifts from what the spawner actually built.

**Not the same component as `Settings/EnvVarsEditor`**, which edits ONE layer.
Pick by question: "change a value" is the editor, "which profile am I running
as?" is this. Do not add an edit mode to this one to cover both.

Credential-shaped keys are masked behind a per-row reveal, decided by
`isSecretEnvKey()`. This is deliberately loose - the surfaces that show an
environment are diagnostic ones people open while screen-sharing for help, so a
false positive costs one click and a false negative leaks a live key.

## Right-Click Image Menu (`ImageContextMenuHost`)

Every image anywhere in the app - raster `<img>`, agent-authored inline `<svg>`, Mermaid charts, thumbnails, the lightbox - gets the same three actions on right-click: **Copy Image**, **Save to Project...**, and **Save As...**.

**Surfaces wire up nothing.** `<ImageContextMenuHost>` is mounted once in `App.tsx` and owns a single delegated `contextmenu` listener on the document that resolves the image from the click target. Do NOT add an `onContextMenu` to a new image surface, do not call a hook, and do not add a per-surface copy/save button pair. There is no per-surface wiring to forget, which is the entire point: the menu used to hang off individual components, so every new image surface silently shipped without it.

- `resolveImageFromEvent(e)` (exported from `ImageContextMenuHost.tsx`) decides what counts. It skips three things: anything inside a `[data-no-image-menu]` subtree, lucide icons (which are `<svg>` but carry the `lucide` class), and anything under 32px rendered (favicons, inline badges).
- **Opting a surface out:** put `data-no-image-menu` on its container. Use this only when the surface owns its own right-click behavior (e.g. `AnnotatorCanvas`). A menu that already handled the click and called `preventDefault()` is skipped automatically via `defaultPrevented` - that is how `LinkContextMenu` / `FileContextMenu` coexist with this one.
- `utils/imageExport.ts` does the work: `copyImageElementToClipboard()` returns `'image' | 'text' | 'failed'` so the UI can admit when only markup or a URL reached the clipboard rather than claiming a paste-able image. `saveImageToProject()` writes into the project's `DIAGRAMS_DIR` (`.maestro/diagrams/`) and works over SSH; `saveImageElementToDisk()` is the native-dialog path. Binary writes go through `fs.writeImageFile` (`fs.writeFile` is UTF-8 and would corrupt the bytes).
- `ImageDestinationModal` is the "Save to Project..." destination picker (folder, file name, SVG/PNG format, live path preview). Not to be confused with `FilePreview/ImageSaveModal`, which is the annotator's overwrite-vs-save-as prompt.

`serializeSvg()` stamps the measured size onto the clone when the source has none. Mermaid sizes charts with CSS (`width="100%"`), and without this the rasterized copy comes out cropped at the browser's 300x150 default.

## Menu / Popover Sizing - Use rem, Not px

The user's font-size setting (`useSettings.ts` writes `document.documentElement.style.fontSize`) scales **everything sized in `rem`** (including Tailwind's `text-xs`/`text-sm` etc.) but **not values in `px`**. If a context menu, dropdown, or tab overlay menu uses `minWidth: '160px'`, the text grows with the user's font setting but the container does not - so labels like "Create New Group" wrap onto two lines at larger sizes.

**Two-part rule:**

1. **Express dimensions in rem.** For any popover / menu / overlay that contains text content, write `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, and `maxHeight` in **rem** (or `em`), not `px`. Conversion: `Npx → (N/16)rem` (160px → 10rem, 200px → 12.5rem, 220px → 13.75rem, 280px → 17.5rem, 320px → 20rem).
2. **Add `whitespace-nowrap` to the menu container.** `minWidth` only sets a lower bound - the container won't actually grow past it unless its content forces it to. By default, long text labels (e.g., "Create New Group") will wrap onto multiple lines instead of pushing the container wider. Putting `whitespace-nowrap` on the menu's outermost container makes labels stay on one line and the container expand to fit them.

The two rules work together: rem keeps the minimum sized correctly across font scales, and `whitespace-nowrap` lets the container grow when individual labels need more room than the minimum allows. Skip rule 2 only when the popover has a `maxWidth` that is intentionally truncating long content (e.g., `BrowserTabItem` clamps URL display with `truncate`).

Existing canonical sites already follow this - see `SessionContextMenu.tsx`, `NodeContextMenu.tsx` (`DocumentGraph/`), `PipelineContextMenu.tsx` (`CuePipelineEditor/`), `FileContextMenu.tsx`, `LinkContextMenu.tsx`, `TerminalSelectionContextMenu.tsx`, `TabBar/AITabOverlayMenu.tsx`, `TabBar/FileTab.tsx`, `TabBar/TerminalTabItem.tsx`, `TabBar/BrowserTabItem.tsx`, `TemplateAutocompleteDropdown.tsx`. When adding a new menu/popover, match this convention so it grows with the user's font size.

This rule applies to **content containers** sized to wrap text. It does NOT apply to layout primitives where px is intentional (icon dimensions, fixed-pixel borders, scrollbar widths, viewport-relative positioning).

## Tab System

Each agent supports multiple AI tabs within its workspace. Tab management hooks live in `src/renderer/hooks/tabs/`.

### Tab Shortcuts

Defined in `TAB_SHORTCUTS` constant. Key bindings:

- `Cmd+T` - New tab
- `Cmd+W` - Close tab
- `Cmd+1-9` - Jump to tab N
- `Cmd+0` - Jump to last tab
- `Cmd+Shift+[`/`]` - Previous/next tab
- `Alt+Cmd+T` - Tab switcher modal
- `Cmd+Shift+T` - Reopen closed tab
- `Cmd+Shift+R` - Rename tab
- `Cmd+R` - Toggle read-only mode
- `Cmd+S` - Toggle save to history

### Tab State

Each tab has an `AITab` type with:

- `id`, `name`, `agentSessionId`
- `starred`, `readOnlyMode`, `saveToHistory`
- `inputValue`, `logs`, `usageStats`
- `wizardState` (for inline wizard sessions)
- `thinkingStartTime`, `showThinking`

### Tab Handlers

`useTabHandlers` (`src/renderer/hooks/tabs/useTabHandlers.ts`) returns a large `TabHandlersReturn` object covering both AI/terminal tabs and file-preview tabs. The main handlers are:

**AI/terminal tab handlers:**

- `handleNewTab()` - create a new AI tab
- `handleTabSelect(tabId)` - switch active tab
- `handleTabClose(tabId)` - close a tab
- `handleCloseAllTabs()` - close every AI tab
- `handleCloseOtherTabs()` - close all except active
- `handleCloseTabsLeft()` / `handleCloseTabsRight()` - close tabs on one side of active
- `handleCloseCurrentTab()` - returns `CloseCurrentTabResult` indicating which tab type was closed
- `handleTabReorder(fromIndex, toIndex)` - reorder AI tabs
- `handleUnifiedTabReorder(fromIndex, toIndex)` - reorder the unified tab bar (mixes AI, file, browser, terminal)
- `handleRequestTabRename(tabId)` - open rename modal
- `handleTabStar(tabId, starred)` - pin/unpin
- `handleTabMarkUnread(tabId)` - mark unread
- `handleToggleTabReadOnlyMode()` / `handleToggleTabSaveToHistory()` / `handleToggleTabShowThinking()` - per-tab toggles

**File-preview tab handlers:**

- `handleOpenFileTab(params)` - open a file preview
- `handleSelectFileTab(tabId)` / `handleCloseFileTab(tabId)` - file tab lifecycle
- `handleFileTabEditModeChange(tabId, editMode)` / `handleFileTabEditContentChange(tabId, content)` - edit mode state
- `handleFileTabScrollPositionChange(tabId, scrollTop)` / `handleFileTabSearchQueryChange(tabId, query)` - per-tab scroll/search state
- `handleReloadFileTab(tabId)` - reload file from disk
- `handleFileTabNavigateBack()` / `handleFileTabNavigateForward()` - per-file-tab navigation history

The hook also returns selectors: `activeTab`, `unifiedTabs`, `activeFileTab`, `activeBrowserTab`, and the file-tab history state (`fileTabBackHistory`, `fileTabForwardHistory`, `fileTabCanGoBack`, `fileTabCanGoForward`).

## Encore Features

Encore features are optional features disabled by default, gated behind the `EncoreFeatureFlags` interface:

```typescript
interface EncoreFeatureFlags {
	directorNotes: boolean;
	usageStats: boolean;
	symphony: boolean;
	maestroCue: boolean;
}
```

### Adding a New Encore Feature

1. Add the flag to `EncoreFeatureFlags` in `src/renderer/types/index.ts`
2. Add default value in `useSettings.ts` state
3. Add toggle UI in `SettingsModal.tsx` (Encore Features section)
4. Gate the feature in `App.tsx` and keyboard handler:

```tsx
const { encoreFeatures } = useSettings();

// In component render:
{encoreFeatures.symphony && <SymphonyModal ... />}

// In keyboard handler:
if (ctx.encoreFeatures.symphony && ctx.isShortcut('openSymphony', e)) {
	ctx.setSymphonyModalOpen(true);
}
```

---

## Settings Pattern

### Architecture

```text
src/renderer/hooks/settings/useSettings.ts   - Hook adapter over Zustand store
src/renderer/stores/settingsStore.ts         - Zustand store (source of truth)
src/main/index.ts                            - IPC handlers for persistence
```

### How Settings Work

1. `useSettings()` returns a `UseSettingsReturn` object with getter/setter pairs for every setting.
2. Setters call `window.maestro.settings.set(key, value)` to persist to Electron Store.
3. On mount, `loadAllSettings()` reads all settings via `window.maestro.settings.getAll()`.
4. On system resume from sleep, settings are reloaded automatically.

### Adding a New Setting

1. Add the field and setter to `UseSettingsReturn` in `src/renderer/hooks/settings/useSettings.ts`
2. Add state and action to `settingsStore.ts`
3. Add IPC handler in `src/main/index.ts` for `settings.get` / `settings.set`
4. Add UI control in the appropriate Settings tab

### Setting Categories

The `UseSettingsReturn` interface groups settings by domain:

- **Conductor Profile** - user's "about me" for AI context
- **LLM** - provider, model slug, API key
- **Shell** - default shell, custom path, args, env vars
- **Font** - family, size (applied to document root for rem scaling)
- **UI** - theme, sidebar widths, enter-to-send, markdown mode, auto-scroll
- **Notifications** - OS notifications, audio feedback, toast duration
- **Updates** - check on startup, beta channel
- **Shortcuts** - editable and tab shortcut maps
- **Custom AI Commands** - user-defined slash commands
- **Stats** - auto-run stats, usage stats, keyboard mastery
- **Onboarding** - tour/wizard completion state
- **Context Management** - auto-grooming settings
- **Encore Features** - optional feature flags
- **Accessibility** - colorblind mode
- **Power Management** - prevent sleep during runs

## State Management (Zustand Stores)

Maestro uses Zustand stores as the primary state management solution. Located in `src/renderer/stores/`:

| Store               | Purpose                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `settingsStore`     | All user preferences and configuration |
| `sessionStore`      | Agent sessions and active session      |
| `tabStore`          | Tab state per session                  |
| `agentStore`        | Agent detection and capabilities       |
| `batchStore`        | Auto Run batch processing state        |
| `groupChatStore`    | Group chat sessions                    |
| `fileExplorerStore` | File tree state                        |
| `modalStore`        | Modal open/close flags                 |
| `notificationStore` | Toast queue and config                 |
| `operationStore`    | Long-running operation tracking        |
| `uiStore`           | Transient UI state (focus, sidebar)    |

### Store Access Patterns

**Inside React:**

```tsx
const sessions = useSessionStore((s) => s.sessions);
const addSession = useSessionStore((s) => s.addSession);
```

**Outside React (services, orchestrators):**

```typescript
const state = useSessionStore.getState();
state.addSession(newSession);
```

### Store Reset in Tests

Zustand stores are singletons. Reset between tests:

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
	useSettingsStore.setState({
		/* initial state */
	});
});
```
