# Checkpoint and Completion Guide — Contract v3.5

## Purpose

Preserve every stage of a long screen, make resumption deterministic, and prevent selected candidates or unresolved pool rows from disappearing.

## Layout

```text
run/
├── run_state.json
├── screening_audit.json
├── screening_funnel.json
├── market_context.json
├── global_sources.json
├── universe_artifact.jsonl
├── candidate_pool_artifact.jsonl
├── candidates/
│   ├── SYMBOL.draft.json
│   └── SYMBOL.verified.json
└── final-snapshot.json
```

Write state atomically. Every state and audit carries v3.5 runtime metadata.

## Initialize

Use `manage_run_state.py init` with live market context, source ledger, price basis, and optional base repository commit.

## Attach the Audit

Use `attach-audit` only with a contract-3.5 audit whose runtime fingerprint matches the installed skill. The manager independently hashes the listing and candidate artifacts and checks their row counts and decisions.

## Save Every Selected Candidate

For each selected symbol, save a draft early and replace it with a verified record after primary-source review. A selected company that becomes an M&A exclusion still receives a verified `excluded` candidate record.

## Funnel Counts

Maintain:

```text
universe_count
listing_in_scope_count
candidate_pool_count
discovery_evaluable_count
deep_dive_selected_count
preflight_passed_count
deep_dive_completed_count
```

`preflight_passed_count` and `deep_dive_completed_count` refer only to selected symbols. The evaluator independently recomputes both counts.

## Completion Gate

The manager enforces:

```text
unprocessed_candidates = selected_symbols − verified_candidate_symbols
```

It refuses `complete` when:

- the pool is unresolved or not exhausted,
- the queue is nonempty,
- generation audit/runtime evidence is invalid,
- any selected symbol lacks a verified record,
- funnel counts are inconsistent.

## Assemble and Evaluate

Assemble only from the attached audit, live source ledger, current context, and verified candidates. Then run:

```bash
python3 skills/us-undervalued-growth-screener/scripts/evaluate_candidates.py \
  --input <final-snapshot.json> \
  --artifact-root <run-root> \
  --output-dir <final-dir> \
  --strict --require-final --language ja
```

## Resume

On resume:

1. verify installed runtime with `--version`;
2. inspect `run_state.json` runtime metadata;
3. reject stale contract revisions/fingerprints;
4. inspect selected, verified, unprocessed, and enrichment queue states;
5. continue from the earliest incomplete stage.

## v3.5 Publication Checkpoint

After strict evaluation, store the generated report JSON/Markdown under the run directory, run the prepublication audit, then build the complete ZIP. A run is operationally complete only when:

```text
strict evaluator exit = 0
prepublish audit exit = 0
bundle builder exit = 0
bundle manifest contains every referenced artifact
```

Do not delete intermediate audit or candidate files before bundling.
