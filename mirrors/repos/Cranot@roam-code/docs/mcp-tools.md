# Roam MCP tools — full reference

The complete tool list for Roam's [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
server. The inventory and marked count blocks are generated from the `@_tool`
decorations in `src/roam/mcp_server.py` by `dev/build_readme_counts.py`. Edit
tool docstrings in source before regenerating the inventory.

<!-- BEGIN auto-count:mcp-tools-headline -->
**246 tools · 17 in the default `core` preset · 8 selectable presets** (`core`, `review`, `refactor`, `debug`, `architecture`, `compliance`, `compile-curated`, `full`).
<!-- END auto-count:mcp-tools-headline -->

```bash
pip install "roam-code[mcp]"
roam mcp
```

Most tools are read-only index queries; side-effect tools are explicitly
annotated. Set `ROAM_MCP_PRESET=full` in the server environment and restart
`roam mcp` for the complete toolset. `roam_expand_toolset` reports preset
contents and restart instructions; it does not change the running server's
registered tools.

Read [detector evidence and limitations](concepts/detector-evidence.md) before
acting on a verdict. MCP arguments/defaults are defined by each tool schema;
they need not match a bare CLI invocation. In particular, `roam_partition`
defaults to four partitions. Static analysis, partial results, and heuristic
scores do not establish runtime coverage, authorship, or permission to delete.

For a POSIX shell, use `ROAM_MCP_PRESET=full roam mcp`. In PowerShell, set
`$env:ROAM_MCP_PRESET = "full"` before starting `roam mcp`. For an editor
integration, set the variable in its MCP server configuration.

<!-- BEGIN auto-count:mcp-tools-default-preset -->
**Default preset:** `core` (17 tools: 16 core + `roam_expand_toolset` meta-tool).
<!-- END auto-count:mcp-tools-default-preset -->

<!-- BEGIN auto-count:mcp-tools-list-table -->
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `roam_adrs` | Discover Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and link them to code modules. Scans well-known ADR directories (``docs/adr/`` / ``architecture/decisions/`` / ...) for markdown files matching ADR naming patterns, parses each ADR's title / status / date / file refs, then cross-references mentioned files against the symbol index. Different from ``roam_doc_staleness`` (inline docstring drift) -- this is the prose-decision-document discoverer. |
| `roam_adversarial` | Frame architectural issues in changed files as challenges the developer must defend: CRITICAL (new cyclic dependencies), HIGH (layer violations, high-confidence anti-patterns), WARNING (cross-cluster coupling, high fan-out), INFO (orphaned symbols). Composes cycles + clusters + layers + catalog + dead + complexity. Different from ``roam_diff`` (blast-radius facts) -- this is the architecture-review framing for code-review agents. |
| `roam_adversarial_review` | Adversarial architecture review: challenges about cycles, anti-patterns, coupling. |
| `roam_affected` | Monorepo impact analysis: find all affected packages/modules from changes. |
| `roam_affected_tests` | List the tests you actually need to run after editing a symbol or file. Use when user asks 'which tests do I run?', 'what tests cover X?', or after Edit/Write. Walks reverse-dependencies with hop distance — closer hops run first. For a full pre-commit check (blast radius + fitness + tests), use roam_prepare_change. |
| `roam_agent_context` | Extract a single agent's partition from the full agent plan: write scope, read-only dependencies, interface contracts, coordination instructions, and key symbols. Different from ``roam_agent_plan`` (full multi-agent view) and ``roam_orchestrate`` (operational dispatch with merge order) -- this is the focused per-worker packet for one agent. |
| `roam_agent_export` | Generate AI agent context file (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/.cursorrules) from index. |
| `roam_agent_opt` | Detect weak agent-contract shape in roam's tool descriptions and envelopes and recommend the stronger shape. |
| `roam_agent_plan` | Decompose partitions into dependency-ordered multi-agent tasks: per-task write scope, read-only dependencies, interface contracts, phase schedule, and merge sequencing. Supports ``plain`` / ``json`` / ``claude-teams`` output formats. Different from ``roam_partition`` (raw analytical manifest) and ``roam_orchestrate`` (operational dispatch) -- this is the dependency-ordered phase schedule. |
| `roam_agent_score` | Aggregate runs from the local ledger and score each agent on a 0..100 composite (run completion, gate adherence, preflight compliance, blast accuracy, replay survival). Empty state (no runs / no matching runs) returns a clean envelope with ``state: "no_data"`` -- never empty stdout, never a crash. Different from the CLI ``roam runs verify`` (HMAC ledger tamper-detection -- CLI-only, there is no MCP tool for it) -- this is the per-agent quality score across runs. |
| `roam_ai_ratio` | Inspect AI-associated source/Git patterns as an uncalibrated score, not an authorship estimate. |
| `roam_ai_readiness` | AI readiness score (0-100): how effectively AI agents can work on this codebase. |
| `roam_alerts` | Active health alerts: thresholds breached on tangle, complexity, churn, or coverage. |
| `roam_algo` | Detect suboptimal algorithms with better alternatives and complexity analysis. |
| `roam_annotate_symbol` | Add persistent annotation to a symbol/file for future agent sessions. |
| `roam_api` | List the public API surface — exported public symbols with signatures and docs. |
| `roam_api_changes` | Detect breaking and non-breaking API changes vs a git ref. |
| `roam_api_drift` | Detect field drift between Laravel/PHP models and TypeScript interfaces. Triggers: 'where do API contracts diverge?', 'find drift between PHP $fillable fields and TypeScript types', 'audit frontend API types'. Pair with roam_endpoints for full route inventory. |
| `roam_architecture_drift` | Compute per-week growth rates for symbols / edges / cycles across a sliding window of persisted ``.roam/snapshots/`` and classify overall direction as ``improving`` / ``degrading`` / ``stable``. Different from ``roam_graph_diff`` (point-in-time delta between two commits) and ``roam_trends`` (metric-level time series) -- this is the snapshot-based architectural-trajectory report. |
| `roam_article_12_check` | Run a 6-item EU AI Act Article 12 readiness checklist over the indexed repo: audit-trail directory, audit-trail records, retention policy doc, technical docs, attestation surface, high-risk classification heuristic. Emits a structured envelope mapping each item to its Article (12, 18, 19) or Annex (III). Different from ``roam_audit_trail_conformance_check`` (per-record chain integrity) -- this is the repo-level governance-readiness assessment. Per the agentic-assurance guardrails: 'maps to' / 'supports evidence for', never 'certifies' / 'makes compliant'. |
| `roam_ask` | Natural-language codebase question dispatcher. Examples: 'is it safe to delete X?', 'where does login validate?', 'what just broke?', 'who owns module Y?'. Routes intent to one recipe in the graph-aware 31-recipe registry. One call replaces Grep+Read for most questions. Run this FIRST when the user asks a code-comprehension question. |
| `roam_at` | Show the code AT a file:line with its enclosing symbol + callers. Targeted alternative to Read-ing the whole file. location is 'file:line'. |
| `roam_attest` | Proof-carrying PR attestation: evidence bundle + merge verdict. |
| `roam_audit` | Run a one-shot codebase architecture audit: bundles health, debt, dead-code, risk, test-pyramid, coverage, and API-surface signals into a single envelope. Designed as the structured artifact a written audit report attaches. Different from ``roam_health`` (single 0-100 score) and ``roam_report`` (preset-driven Markdown report) -- this is the verdict-first audit packet for governance and onboarding. |
| `roam_audit_trail_conformance_check` | Score the audit trail against an EU AI Act Article 12 checklist. |
| `roam_audit_trail_export` | Export the audit trail as markdown / json / csv for procurement review. |
| `roam_audit_trail_verify` | Verify SHA-256 chain integrity of a roam audit trail. |
| `roam_auth_gaps` | Find endpoints lacking auth / authorization checks ranked by confidence. Triggers: 'which routes are unprotected?', 'show me auth gaps', 'audit handler protection'. Pair with roam_taint for taint-source reachability over the unprotected surfaces. |
| `roam_batch_get` | Get details for up to 50 symbols in one call. Replaces 50 sequential roam_symbol calls. |
| `roam_batch_search` | Search up to 10 patterns in one call. Replaces 10 sequential roam_search_symbol calls. |
| `roam_bisect_blame` | Find snapshots that caused architectural degradation, ranked by impact. |
| `roam_boundary` | Surface public-by-accident exports + changed-range layer violations. Two closed-enum kinds: public_by_accident (warning, _-prefixed name in __all__) and wrong_direction_import (high, lower-layer module imports from higher-layer caller). |
| `roam_breaking_changes` | Detect breaking API changes between git refs: removed exports, changed signatures. |
| `roam_brief` | Compose a one-page agent briefing covering five sections: ``next`` (what ``roam next`` would recommend), ``highlights`` (stack / top danger zones / top mined laws from ``roam agents-md``), ``pr_bundle`` (current PR-bundle status on the active branch), ``mode`` (active agent mode and its allow-list size), and ``runs`` (the N most-recent runs from the ledger). Designed as the FIRST command an agent runs when joining a roam-indexed repo. Different from ``roam_next`` (single-command router) -- this is the verdict-first session kickoff packet. |
| `roam_budget_check` | Check changes against architectural budgets (cycles, health floor, complexity). |
| `roam_bus_factor` | Score knowledge-concentration risk per directory: Shannon entropy over unique authors, primary-author share, last activity, and a staleness factor. Flags CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW per module. Different from ``roam_owner`` (per-file blame) and ``roam_congestion`` (too-many-authors merge-conflict risk) -- this measures knowledge-loss risk. |
| `roam_capsule_export` | Sanitized structural graph export without code bodies (privacy-safe). |
| `roam_catalog` | Return the full machine-readable list of every roam MCP tool currently registered, including title, description, and capability flags (core / read_only / destructive). Use this once at session start to discover what's available without enumerating tools. |
| `roam_causal_graph` | Build per-symbol causal graphs: edges from inputs (parameters / globals / env reads) to sinks (side-effecting calls / return / raise / mutation). Six causal kinds: ``param_to_effect``, ``param_to_return``, ``global_to_effect``, ``global_to_mutation``, ``env_to_effect``, ``param_to_raise``. Heuristic line-level text scan -- false negatives expected. Different from ``roam_taint`` (cross-symbol taint propagation) -- this is intra-symbol dataflow only. |
| `roam_cga_emit` | Emit a Code Graph Attestation — in-toto v1 statement whose predicateType is the identifier `https://roam-code.com/spec/CodeGraph/v1` (or `https://roam-code.com/spec/CodeGraph-AIBOM/v1` with --aibom). Those are in-toto TypeURIs, not fetchable pages; the predicate schema is documented at https://roam-code.com/docs/architecture. Merkle root over symbol fingerprints + edge-bundle digest. Optional cosign keyless or offline signing. |
| `roam_cga_verify` | Verify a Code Graph Attestation — re-derives the Merkle root + edge-bundle digest from the live DB and compares to the bundled predicate, AND verifies the cosign signature on the sibling `.bundle`. Fails closed (exit 5) when no bundle is present unless no_cosign=True is passed to acknowledge predicate-only verification. |
| `roam_changelog` | List commits since last tag, optionally formatted as a markdown CHANGELOG draft. |
| `roam_check_rules` | Run 10 built-in structural rules: cycles, fan-out, complexity, tests, god classes, layer violations. |
| `roam_clean` | Remove orphaned index entries (files deleted from disk) without full rebuild. |
| `roam_clones` | Detect near-duplicate code via AST structural hashing (Type-2 clones). |
| `roam_closure` | Minimal set of changes needed for rename/delete/modify (exact files + lines). |
| `roam_clusters` | Show Louvain code clusters and directory mismatches. Returns per-cluster size, cohesion, conductance, modularity Q, mega-cluster sub-group breakdowns, and inter-cluster coupling. Different from ``roam_layers`` (dependency-layer violations) -- this groups by community detection, not by topological depth. |
| `roam_codeowners` | CODEOWNERS coverage, ownership distribution, unowned files, drift detection. |
| `roam_collapse` | Run the benign-default collapse detector. Find error paths that make unreadable, invalid, or unavailable sources indistinguishable from empty sources across Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and shell. |
| `roam_commands` | List the repo's own runnable build/test/lint commands, classified by kind/scope/cost with evidence. |
| `roam_compare` | Diff two roam indices structurally: reports symbols added/removed/moved, per-file complexity deltas above a threshold, language counts, and a one-line health verdict (improved / regressed / sideways). Different from ``roam_graph_diff`` (commit-range graph delta from one index) -- this is the cross-index structural delta for release-vs-release comparisons. |
| `roam_compatibility` | Detect outbound surface regressions vs a baseline snapshot. Closed-enum verdicts: no regressions / surface additions / surface drift / baseline stale / breaking changes. Compares commands, flags, envelope summary fields, MCP tools, MCP tool parameters, and preset counts; does NOT compare parameter types, defaults, tool descriptions, command categories or runtime behavior. Capture the baseline via CLI: roam compatibility --write-baseline PATH. |
| `roam_compile` | Compile a freeform coding task into a structured envelope an AI agent can consume. Returns the ArtifactSelector verdict (facts / lean / full envelope) plus the deterministic plan. Empirically validated on Opus 4.8 (2026-05-28): FactsEnvelope delivers 99% of vanilla quality at 54% of vanilla cost. Different from roam_plan (symbol-centric execution plan) -- this is the freeform-task compiler. |
| `roam_complete` | Prefix completion for symbols / file paths / commands. Faster than search; returns just names. |
| `roam_complexity_report` | Functions ranked by cognitive complexity above threshold. |
| `roam_congestion` | Detect developer congestion: files with too many concurrent authors within a sliding time window. Combines author count, churn intensity, and complexity into a congestion score that predicts merge conflicts and coordination failures. Different from ``roam_bus_factor`` (knowledge-loss risk) and ``roam_owner`` (per-file blame breakdown) -- this measures too-many-cooks contention. |
| `roam_context` | Get the minimum files + line ranges needed to understand or modify a symbol. Use when user says 'show me X', 'I need to change Y', 'how does Z work?'. Returns targeted reads ranked by PageRank — cheaper than Read'ing whole files. For pre-change safety (blast radius + tests + effects), use roam_prepare_change instead. |
| `roam_conventions` | Auto-detect codebase naming, file, import, and export conventions with outliers. |
| `roam_coupling` | Use for: 'what files change together?' / 'find hidden coupling not visible in imports' / 'which sibling file should I also update?'. Pick over reading git log manually — surfaces co-change partners the call graph misses. Use roam_fan for structural connectivity, roam_dark_matter for the latent variant. |
| `roam_coverage_gaps` | Find unprotected entry points: top-level exported functions / methods that have no call-graph path to a required gate symbol (auth / permission / validation). Supports exact gate names, regex patterns, framework presets (python / javascript / go / java-maven / rust), and a ``.roam-gates.yml`` sidecar config. Different from ``roam_auth_gaps`` (PHP/Laravel source analysis) and ``roam_test_gaps`` (untested symbols in changed files) -- this walks the call graph to verify every entry reaches a required gate. |
| `roam_critique` | Post-edit patch verifier. Pass `git diff` output as diff_text. Catches clones-not-edited (sibling duplicates the agent missed) and high-blast-radius edits. Grounded in the indexed graph, not heuristics. Triggers: 'review my patch', 'is this PR safe?', after generating any non-trivial diff. |
| `roam_cut` | Find fragile domain boundaries via minimum-cut analysis. Computes the thinnest edge cuts between architectural clusters and the highest-impact 'leak edges' whose removal would best improve domain isolation. Different from ``roam_split`` (decomposes a single file) -- this finds boundaries between clusters. |
| `roam_cut_analysis` | Minimum cut analysis: fragile domain boundaries, highest-impact leak edges. |
| `roam_cycles` | Show import/call cycles (Tarjan strongly-connected components) of the symbol graph. Returns per-cycle size, member files/symbols, and an `actionable` flag (spans >=2 distinct non-test files). The focused counterpart to the cycles section of ``roam_health``; sibling of ``roam_clusters`` / ``roam_layers``. |
| `roam_dark_matter` | File pairs that co-change without structural links (hidden coupling). |
| `roam_dashboard` | Unified single-screen codebase status: health, hotspots, bus factor, dead code, AI rot. |
| `roam_dead_code` | Use for: 'what can I safely delete?' / 'find dead code' / 'list unused exports'. Pick over manual grep sweeps — filters out entry points and framework lifecycle hooks, ranks candidates by deletion safety. Pair with roam_safe_delete for per-symbol deletion verdicts. |
| `roam_debt` | Rank files by tech-debt score with SQALE remediation-cost estimates. Triggers: 'where's the worst debt?', 'what should we refactor next?', 'estimate cleanup cost'. Pair with roam_complexity_report for per-function brain-method targeting. |
| `roam_delete_check` | Gate the diff (working / staged / PR / HEAD) on surviving references to deleted symbols and files. Per-deletion verdict: SAFE (no surviving references), LIKELY-SAFE (survivors only in tests / docs / unreachable code), or BREAK-RISK (survivors in reachable code); REVIEW means a check is incomplete. Different from ``roam_critique`` (PR-wide diff review) -- this targets the deletion surface specifically with CI-gate semantics (BREAK-RISK and incomplete checks trip the gate). |
| `roam_deps` | Use for: 'what does file X import?' / 'which files depend on module Y?' / 'show me the importers of Z'. Pick this for file/module-level coupling before refactors; symbol-level lookups belong in roam_uses. Set multi=True to get imports + importers + git co-change coupling in ONE envelope (do this instead of shelling out to `roam deps --multi` or hand-querying the index). Run in parallel with roam_coupling for the biggest token win. |
| `roam_describe` | Auto-generate a project description for AI coding agents: multi-section Markdown report covering overview, directories, entry points, key abstractions, architecture, and testing. Different from ``roam_understand`` (compact codebase overview) -- this is the comprehensive prose description for CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / .cursor/rules. The wrapper emits to stdout; on-disk writes are deferred to the CLI (``roam describe --write``) so the MCP surface stays read-only. |
| `roam_dev_profile` | Developer behavioral profiling: commit time patterns, change scatter (Gini), burst detection. |
| `roam_diagnose` | Root cause analysis: upstream/downstream suspects ranked by composite risk. |
| `roam_diagnose_issue` | Root-cause triage for a failing symbol. Pass the suspect symbol. Ranks upstream / downstream callers by risk + lists side effects + transactional boundaries. Replaces manual call-graph Grep+Read. Triggers: 'X is broken', 'test Y fails', 'why does Z return null?'. |
| `roam_diff` | Show the blast radius of your edits BEFORE you commit. Run after Edit/Write tools to see affected symbols, files, tests, plus coupling and fitness warnings. Use when user asks 'what did my change break?', 'safe to commit?'. Replaces ad-hoc `git diff --stat` inspection with graph-aware impact data. For PR-level risk verdict, use roam_pr_risk. |
| `roam_disambiguate` | List every symbol matching a name with file/line/kind/signature/PageRank — pick the right overload. |
| `roam_doc_drift` | Run a mechanical prose-doc gate over Markdown path, count, and project-version claims. Use it before release or in CI to find objective documentation drift without model calls. |
| `roam_doc_intent` | Link documentation to code: find drift, dead refs, undocumented symbols. |
| `roam_doc_staleness` | Run a semantic docstring-drift audit: flag documented parameters, returns, or raises that no longer match code. Pass ``include_prose_drift`` to include optional blame-only summary drift. Different from ``roam_docs_coverage`` (missing docs ranked by PageRank) and ``roam_stale_refs`` (dangling doc links) -- this audits concrete claims in existing docs. |
| `roam_docs_coverage` | Doc coverage + stale-doc drift with PageRank-ranked missing docs. |
| `roam_doctor` | Setup diagnostics: Python version, tree-sitter, git, index existence, freshness, SQLite. |
| `roam_dogfood` | One-shot full-stack run: audit + pr-analyze + audit-trail + conformance. |
| `roam_dogfood_aggregate` | Triage view over the dogfood eval corpus: totals, per-command findings count, by-status / by-severity / by-type breakdowns. Reads ``internal/dogfood/evals/`` (or an override path). Useful for agents auditing roam-code itself; mostly a no-op on consumer repos that have no dogfood corpus. |
| `roam_drift` | Ownership drift detection: declared CODEOWNERS vs actual time-decayed contributors. |
| `roam_duplicates` | Detect semantically duplicate functions via structural similarity. |
| `roam_effects` | Side effects of functions: DB writes, network, filesystem (direct + transitive). |
| `roam_endpoints` | List all REST/GraphQL/gRPC endpoints with handlers, methods, and locations. |
| `roam_entry_points` | Catalog every entry point into the codebase: HTTP routes, CLI commands, scheduled jobs, event handlers, message consumers, main functions, and exports. Reports per-entry reachability coverage -- what fraction of symbols each entry transitively reaches through the call graph. |
| `roam_eval_retrieve` | Run the retrieval eval harness over a labeled task set. Reports recall@K, mean reciprocal rank, and per-task diagnostics. Supports a weight sweep and CodeRAG-Bench / BEIR emit formats for public leaderboard submission. |
| `roam_evidence_diff` | Diff two ``ChangeEvidence`` packets: shows hash drift, schema drift, added/removed refs, missing evidence, and changed verdicts. Useful for reviewing PR re-runs, comparing replay windows, or auditing whether a fresh evidence packet has improved or regressed against a stored baseline. Different from ``roam_compare`` (two-index structural delta) -- this is the two-packet evidence delta. |
| `roam_evidence_doctor` | Diagnose a ChangeEvidence packet's health: schema validity, closed-enum conformance, content_hash integrity, completeness banner tier (STRONG / PARTIAL / INSUFFICIENT), declared redactions, and actionable next steps for partial / missing evidence questions. Read-only. |
| `roam_evidence_oscal` | Emit an OSCAL v1.2 document. Default kind='control-mapping' compiles the roam control map (maps roam evidence to EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, NIST AI 600-1, NIST SP 800-218A, SOC 2, internal AI-change policy). kind='assessment-results' compiles a per-run AR document from a ChangeEvidence packet (requires evidence_path); AR mandates an Assessment Plan reference — pass import_ap_ref for an external AP or omit it to inline a synthesized stub AP. Supports evidence for the listed frameworks — does not certify compliance. Two roam-specific concepts (authority_refs, redactions) surface as OSCAL ``prop`` extensions under the ``urn:roam:oscal:v1`` namespace. |
| `roam_expand_toolset` | List available tool presets or show contents of a preset. Presets: core (minimal), review, refactor, debug, architecture, compliance, compile-curated, and full (every tool). Pass a preset name to list its tools. |
| `roam_explore` | Codebase exploration bundle: understand overview + optional symbol deep-dive in one call. |
| `roam_fan` | Show fan-in / fan-out: the most-connected symbols or files. Flags hub / spreader / HIGH-RISK structural hotspots based on cross-file import / call edges. Different from coupling (co-change frequency) -- this measures structural connectivity. |
| `roam_fetch_handle` | Fetch all or part of a large payload by handle — supports byte slice, section pick, jq projection. |
| `roam_file_info` | File skeleton: all symbols with signatures, kinds, line ranges. |
| `roam_findings_count` | Show per-detector finding counts. Useful for spotting which detectors have migrated to the central registry vs which are still only emitting to their detector-specific tables. |
| `roam_findings_list` | List rows from the central findings registry, optionally filtered by detector or subject. Cross-detector view -- every migrated detector (clones, dead, complexity, smells, n1, missing-index, ...) emits here behind one schema. |
| `roam_findings_show` | Show full detail for a single finding by its stable ``finding_id_str``. Returns the detector version, subject, confidence tier, claim, evidence JSON, and any suppressions. |
| `roam_fingerprint` | Topology fingerprint for cross-repo comparison or structural drift tracking. |
| `roam_fitness` | Run architectural fitness functions from ``.roam/fitness.yaml``. Rule ``type`` is a closed set: ``dependency`` (also how layering is enforced -- forbid the edge), ``metric``, ``naming``, ``trend``; any other type is reported ERROR and exits non-zero rather than being skipped (W1450). Different from ``roam_preflight`` (compound 6-signal pre-edit gate) -- this is the dedicated fitness surface with per-rule output, baseline / delta mode, and trend regression guards. |
| `roam_flag_dead` | Detect potentially stale feature-flag code: flags referenced only once, flags always checked with the same boolean default, and flags clustered in a single file. Recognises LaunchDarkly, Unleash, Split, generic ``feature_flag(...)`` calls, and ``FEATURE_*`` env-var patterns. Different from ``roam_dead_code`` (graph-unreachable symbols) -- this targets code that is alive in the graph but gated behind flags that may never fire. |
| `roam_fleet_plan` | Plan a multi-agent fleet for a goal — graph-aware partition (Louvain + co-change) emits .roam-fleet.json for Composio / Copilot CLI / raw. |
| `roam_fn_coupling` | Show function-level temporal coupling: symbol pairs that change together across commits. Different from ``roam_coupling`` (file-level pairs) -- this drills into co-changing symbols inside and across files, with optional structural-edge filtering. |
| `roam_for_bug_fix` | Compound: diagnose + affected_tests + diff + context for a symbol you're about to debug. |
| `roam_for_new_feature` | Compound: understand + search + context + complexity for an area you're about to add code to. |
| `roam_for_refactor` | Compound: preflight + impact + complexity_report + clones for a symbol you're about to refactor. |
| `roam_for_security_review` | Compound: taint + vuln + critique + adversarial for a security review pass. |
| `roam_forecast` | Predict when metrics will exceed thresholds (Theil-Sen regression). |
| `roam_full_coupling` | Composite coupling report for ONE file in a single envelope: top-N temporal coupling pairs touching the file + structural imports/importers + top-N file symbols. Use instead of chaining roam_coupling + roam_deps + roam_file_info. |
| `roam_generate_plan` | Structured execution plan for code modification: read order, invariants, tests. |
| `roam_get_annotations` | Read annotations for symbols, files, or project. Filter by tag/date. |
| `roam_get_invariants` | Implicit contracts for symbols: signature stability, usage spread, breaking risk. |
| `roam_graph_diff` | Show the structural graph delta between two snapshots. Surfaces new / removed symbols, edge churn, degree shifts, new cycles, layer migrations, and likely renames. Reads persisted snapshots from ``.roam/snapshots/`` -- capture one with ``--save-snapshot``. |
| `roam_graph_stats` | Report graph-level invariants: density, connected components, average in/out degree, top in-degree symbols, and approximate diameter. One overview number for 'how dense, connected, and cyclic is this codebase'. |
| `roam_grep` | Run index-aware grep across the codebase. Returns matches with their enclosing symbol, reachability badge, PageRank, clone-class, and bridge annotations. Supports multi-pattern, source-only / test-only filters, reachable-from / unreachable filters, co-occurrence across patterns, and rank-by importance. Request bounded context packets or whole enclosing symbols to replace the usual grep-then-read loop. |
| `roam_guard` | Check breaking-change risk for a symbol before editing: 0..100 risk score with component breakdown (blast radius, complexity, centrality, test gap, layer analysis) plus caller / callee lists and covering tests -- all within a ~2K-token budget. Different from ``roam_preflight`` (file / staged / coupling / convention / fitness composite) -- this is the per-symbol quantified risk score for sub-agent dispatch. |
| `roam_guard_clean` | Prune the verdict log at `.roam/verdict-log.jsonl` to its last N entries (default 500). Atomic rewrite — concurrent appenders never see a partial file. Pair `dry_run=True` for a probe. |
| `roam_guard_diff` | Verdict diff between two bundle snapshots (or the two most-recent verdict-log entries via `from_log=True`). Returns the verdict delta + reasons added/resolved + file/check counts. Answers 'did my last commit help?' |
| `roam_guard_doctor` | Roam Guard preflight: 8 health checks (.roam dir, bundles, rule pack, command graph, git, GitHub token, verdict log, yaml lib). Run once before adopting Roam Guard in CI. |
| `roam_guard_history` | List past Roam Guard verdicts on this repo (reads `.roam/verdict-log.jsonl` fast-path when present, falls back to scanning `.roam/pr-bundles/`). Supports `--verdict` and `--limit` filters. |
| `roam_guard_pr` | Aggregate Roam Guard PR check: auto-collect bundle, compose AgentChangeProofBundle v1, render verdict (pass/pass_with_warnings/needs_review/blocked), optionally POST a GitHub Check Run. The headline tool — drop this into a CI step to gate any PR. |
| `roam_guard_rules` | Inspect or validate a Roam Guard rule pack. Subcommands: `show` (default) renders the pack, `validate` checks schema, `test` matches a path against the pack. |
| `roam_health` | Codebase health score (0-100) with issue breakdown, cycles, bottlenecks. |
| `roam_history_grep` | Run git pickaxe (``-S`` / ``-G``) through commit history. Returns commits that introduced or removed the literal string, with author, date, short SHA, and summary per commit. |
| `roam_hotspots` | Show runtime hotspots: symbols ranked by static analysis vs real production traces (requires ``roam ingest-trace`` to have populated ``runtime_stats``). Each row is tagged UPGRADE (runtime-critical but statically safe), CONFIRMED (both agree), or DOWNGRADE (statically risky but low traffic). Different from ``roam_why_slow`` (top-N by latency alone) -- this classifies static vs runtime mismatch. |
| `roam_hover` | One-line architectural summary for a symbol — kind, location, blast-radius bucket, top caller, top callee. |
| `roam_idempotency` | Classify symbols by retry safety: ``idempotent`` (pure, read-only I/O, write-with-check patterns like ``mkdir(exist_ok=True)`` / ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` / ``UPSERT`` / ``if not exists: create``), ``non_idempotent`` (naive writes, mutations, appends), or ``unknown`` (process spawn / unreadable body). Composes on top of ``roam_side_effects``. Different from ``roam_tx_boundaries`` (transaction correctness) -- this answers ``is it safe to retry?``. |
| `roam_impact` | Blast radius for 'is it safe to change?' — symbols + files affected, in 5 lines. Compact decision-support output. Round 4 / S: the right default tool for safety-checks; preflight is heavier. |
| `roam_ingest_trace` | Ingest runtime traces (OTel/Jaeger/Zipkin), match spans to symbols. |
| `roam_init` | Initialize roam and build the first index. Task-mode for non-blocking setup. |
| `roam_intent` | Link documentation to code: find which docs mention which symbols, and detect doc-to-code drift (references to non-existent symbols). Different from ``roam_docs_coverage`` (PageRank-ranked missing-docstring hotlist) and ``roam_doc_staleness`` (stale docstring content) -- this is the prose-doc-to-symbol linker plus drift detector. |
| `roam_invariants` | Discover implicit contracts for a symbol or the public API surface: signature shape, parameter count and ordering, usage spread across files, dependency set. Different from ``roam_check_rules`` (explicit governance rules) -- this is the AUTO-discovered implicit-contract surface so agents know what must stay stable when modifying a symbol. |
| `roam_layers` | Show topological dependency layers and violations. Returns each layer's symbol count, directory breakdown, and any back-edges that violate the topological order. Different from ``roam_clusters`` (community detection) -- this measures dependency depth. |
| `roam_llm_smells` | Run LLM-API integration linter over indexed files: detects unpinned model versions, missing max_tokens, prompt injection via user-input concatenation, unvalidated json.loads on LLM output, and missing temperature. Different from ``roam_vibe_check`` (AI-generated code shape) and ``roam_smells`` (structural anti-patterns) -- this is the production gate for human-authored LLM-using code. |
| `roam_map` | Show project skeleton: directory tree, entry points, top symbols by PageRank, language counts. Different from ``roam_describe`` (prose description) and ``roam_minimap`` (sentinel-block one-pager for CLAUDE.md) -- this is the structured skeleton with directories, entry points, and ranked symbols for agent onboarding. |
| `roam_metrics` | Show unified per-file or per-symbol metrics: cognitive complexity, fan-in / fan-out, SNA centrality vector (PageRank / betweenness / closeness / eigenvector / clustering coefficient), composite debt score, churn, test coverage, and comprehension difficulty in a single view. |
| `roam_metrics_push` | Push metrics-only summary to Roam Cloud Lite. **Default is dry-run.** |
| `roam_migration_plan` | Generate an ordered migration plan with risk + blast-radius per step from a target-architecture YAML spec or inline ``--move SYMBOL=path/to/new/file`` directives. Each step is annotated with caller count and a derived risk score so agents can decide where to stop or insert tests. Stops at the first step exceeding ``max_risk``. Different from ``roam_simulate`` (counterfactual single-move analysis) -- this is the ordered multi-step plan with a risk gate. |
| `roam_migration_safety` | Detect non-idempotent database migrations unsafe to re-run. Triggers: 'audit migration safety', 'find non-idempotent migrations', 'which DDL would break on replay?'. Pair with roam_tx_boundaries for transaction-correctness analysis. |
| `roam_minimap` | Generate a compact ~20-line codebase minimap for CLAUDE.md injection: tech stack, annotated directory tree, key symbols by PageRank, high-fan-in symbols to avoid, hotspots, detected conventions. Different from ``roam_describe`` (long-form prose) and ``roam_map`` (structured skeleton) -- this is the sentinel-block one-pager. The wrapper emits to stdout; on-disk updates are deferred to the CLI (``roam minimap --update`` / ``--init-notes``) so the MCP surface stays read-only. |
| `roam_missing_index` | Detect queries hitting non-indexed columns flagged as slow-query risks. Triggers: 'find slow queries', 'audit database indexes', 'where are the N+1 candidates?'. Pair with roam_n1 for per-property iteration patterns. |

| `roam_mutate` | Agentic editing: move/rename/add-call/extract symbols with auto-import rewrite. |
| `roam_n1` | Detect N+1 I/O patterns in ORM code (Laravel/Django/Rails/SQLAlchemy/JPA). |
| `roam_next` | Suggest the next ``roam`` command based on cheap repo-state signals: index presence, staleness, working-tree dirtiness, recent envelope, and recent memory. Emits one imperative recommendation in <200ms. Different from ``roam_brief`` (multi-section session kickoff) and ``roam_workflow`` (curated multi-step recipes) -- this is the single-command router. |
| `roam_observability_opt` | Detect code that leaves systems hard to debug (raw debug prints, ...) and recommend the structured-logging shape. |
| `roam_onboard` | Generate a new-developer onboarding guide for the codebase. |
| `roam_oracle_batch` | Run multiple oracle queries in one call. Items: [{name, oracle, max_hops?}, ...] where oracle is one of symbol-exists, route-exists, is-test-only, is-reachable-from-entry, is-clone-of. |

Returns a yes/no verdict envelope with the matched clone class size. Different from ``roam_clones`` (full clone-pair enumeration) -- this is the cheap boolean lookup for one symbol's clone status. |
| `roam_oracle_is_reachable_from_entry` | Answer the boolean oracle question: is the symbol reachable from any entry point via the call graph (BFS up to ``max_hops`` depth)? Useful for sniffing orphans and production-vs-tooling code. Different from ``roam_dead_code`` (broad dead-symbol detection) and ``roam_entry_points`` (entry-point enumeration) -- this is the cheap boolean lookup for one symbol's reachability. |
| `roam_oracle_is_test_only` | Answer the boolean oracle question: are ALL callers of this symbol in test files? Useful for sniffing test fixtures and dead-but-test-only helpers. Different from ``roam_dead_code`` (broad dead-symbol detection) -- this is the cheap boolean lookup for one symbol's test-only status. |
| `roam_oracle_route_exists` | Answer the boolean oracle question: does a route handler match this URL path? Returns a yes/no verdict envelope with the matched handler's file + kind when found. Different from ``roam_endpoints`` (full endpoint enumeration) -- this is the cheap boolean lookup for one route precondition check. |
| `roam_oracle_symbol_exists` | Answer the boolean oracle question: does a symbol with this name exist in the index? Returns a yes/no verdict envelope with the matched symbol's file + kind when found. Different from ``roam_search_symbol`` (top-N ranked hits) -- this is the cheap boolean lookup for agent precondition checks. |
| `roam_oracle_test_only` | Alias of roam_oracle_is_test_only — preserves the shorter name agents sometimes guess. |
| `roam_orchestrate` | Partition codebase for parallel multi-agent work with exclusive write zones. |
| `roam_orphan_imports` | List imports that don't resolve to any indexed module or installed package -- catches typo'd local imports, missing packages, and dangling relative imports. Covers Python (default), JavaScript / TypeScript, and Go. Different from ``roam_dead_code`` (unused symbols) -- this targets import-statement orphans. |
| `roam_orphan_routes` | Find backend routes lacking a frontend consumer — the dead-endpoint surface. Triggers: 'which routes can we delete?', 'find unused endpoints', 'audit API surface coverage'. Pair with roam_dead_code for symbol-level dead-export detection. |
| `roam_over_fetch` | Models serializing too many fields (data over-exposure risk). |
| `roam_owner` | Show code ownership computed from git blame: per-author line counts, percentages, last-active dates, and a fragmentation index. Works on a file or a directory prefix. Different from ``roam_codeowners`` (which reads the CODEOWNERS file) -- this measures actual ownership. |

| `roam_path_coverage` | Critical call paths with zero test protection, ranked by risk. |
| `roam_patterns` | Detect positive architectural patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Repository, Middleware, Strategy, and Decorator. Different from ``roam_smells`` (negative anti-patterns) -- this discovers intentional design patterns. |
| `roam_plan` | Generate a structured execution plan for modifying code: read-order (call-graph BFS), invariants (mined contracts), blast-radius preview, and per-task heuristics. Five task types: ``refactor`` / ``debug`` / ``extend`` / ``review`` / ``understand``. Different from ``roam_plan_refactor`` (refactoring-specific simulation) and ``roam_preflight`` (blast-radius gate) -- this is the general-purpose work plan for any task type. |
| `roam_plan_refactor` | Build an ordered refactor plan for one symbol using risk/test/simulation context. |
| `roam_postmortem` | Replay current detectors against past commits: walks a git commit range, runs ``roam critique`` against each commit's diff, and reports which findings would have surfaced pre-merge. Useful for retrospective replay -- 'would today's detector set have caught the incidents already in history?' Different from the CLI ``roam pr-replay`` (one PR replay -- CLI-only, there is no MCP tool for it) -- this is the range-replay over historical commits. |
| `roam_pr_analyze` | Agent-aware PR risk verdict — INTENTIONAL / SAFE / REVIEW / BLOCK. |
| `roam_pr_comment_render` | Render a markdown PR comment from a pr-analyze JSON envelope. |
| `roam_pr_diff` | Structural graph delta of code changes: metric deltas, layer violations. |
| `roam_pr_prep` | One-shot pre-PR fitness check: bundles ``diff`` blast radius + ``critique`` + ``pr-risk`` into a single envelope with a ``ready_to_open`` verdict. Different from ``roam_pr_risk`` (composite risk score alone) and ``roam_critique`` (clones-not-edited + blast-radius alone) -- this is the three-section pre-PR rollup with the go/no-go verdict. |
| `roam_pr_risk` | Risk score (0-100) for pending changes with per-file breakdown. |
| `roam_preflight` | Pre-change safety check: blast radius, tests, complexity, fitness. Call BEFORE modifying code. |

| `roam_py_modern` | Python modernisation signal: walrus, match, PEP 604/585, f-strings vs legacy. |
| `roam_py_types` | Python type-annotation health: % public fns fully typed, Any usage, legacy typing. |
| `roam_pytest_fixtures` | pytest fixture chain: top fixtures by dependent count, or per-symbol dependency walk. |
| `roam_reachability_triage` | Classify vulnerability-flow findings as reachable or not reachable from entrypoints through local call-graph evidence. This MCP tool is read-only: it does not write or move the reachability baseline; use the CLI for baseline management. |
| `roam_recommend` | Surface symbols related to a given symbol via three signal sources combined: call-graph neighbours (1-hop in + out), git co-change (other symbols whose files changed in the same commits), and persisted clone siblings (when ``roam clones --persist`` was run). Each candidate gets a score that's the normalised sum of the three contributions. Different from ``roam_impact`` (transitive blast radius) -- this fuses co-change + clones into the ranking. |
| `roam_refs_text` | Audit literal strings across the project and emit a per-string verdict: SAFE-TO-REMOVE / REVIEW / LOAD-BEARING. Groups every reference by surface (code, test, docs, config, generated, vendored) and annotates reachability for code hits. Require REVIEW when a failed search leaves reference absence unconfirmed. |

Different from ``roam_audit`` (single fixed bundle) -- this is the preset-driven multi-command roll-up with optional Markdown output and strict exit-code gating. |
| `roam_reset` | Delete index DB and rebuild from scratch. Requires force=True. Recovery for corrupted indexes. |
| `roam_retrieve` | Graph-aware context for free-form tasks: FTS5 + structural rerank (PageRank + clones) + token budget. |
| `roam_review_change` | Change review bundle: pr-risk + breaking changes + structural diff in one call. |
| `roam_risk` | Rank symbols by domain-weighted risk: combines static risk (fan-in + fan-out + betweenness) with domain criticality weights so financial / auth / data-integrity symbols rank higher than UI symbols. Different from ``roam_fan`` (raw fan-in/out degree) and ``roam_hotspots`` (runtime hotspot classification) -- this is the semantic-domain-weighted risk heatmap. |
| `roam_rules_check` | Evaluate custom governance rules from .roam/rules/ YAML files. |
| `roam_rules_validate` | Lint a `.roam/rules.yml` for shippability before customers see it. |

| `roam_safe_delete` | Fuse dead-code, blast-radius, and test-coverage signals into a single deletion verdict: SAFE / REVIEW / UNSAFE. Reports direct callers (non-test), transitive dependents, affected files, and a public-API bump that flips SAFE -> REVIEW for exported symbols whose name matches a common public-API prefix. Different from ``roam_dead_code`` (all unreferenced symbols) and ``roam_impact`` (transitive blast radius) -- this is the focused deletion review. Imported files with unresolved symbol use require REVIEW; absent indexed references do not prove absence of use. |
| `roam_safe_zones` | Classify the refactor containment zone around a symbol or file: ISOLATED (no external connections), CONTAINED (<=5 boundary symbols), or EXPOSED (>5). Reports strictly-internal vs boundary symbols and external caller / callee counts per boundary. Different from ``roam_impact`` (unbounded reverse blast radius) and ``roam_closure`` (exact locations needing modification) -- this maps the bounded zone where it is safe to refactor freely. |
| `roam_sbom` | Emit a Software Bill of Materials (CycloneDX 1.7 by default, or SPDX 2.3) enriched with call-graph reachability — distinguishes phantom dependencies from those actually exercised. Pair with --aibom for the AIBOM extension required by EU AI Act Art. 50. |
| `roam_search_semantic` | Find symbols by natural language query (hybrid BM25 + vector + framework packs). |
| `roam_search_symbol` | Use for: 'where is X defined?' / 'find function Y' / 'locate class Z'. Pick over Bash grep for function/class/method lookups — PageRank-ranked file:line + qualified names, no string/comment false positives. For 3+ symbols use roam_batch_search; for callers use roam_uses. |
| `roam_secrets` | Scan for hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens, passwords (25 patterns). |
| `roam_semantic_diff` | Structural change summary: what symbols were added/removed/modified. |
| `roam_session_metrics` | Local-only telemetry: per-tool invocation counts grouped by outcome (success / rate_limited / error). Helps answer "which tools are agents actually using?" and "which tools are dead weight?". Never phones home — counters live in the MCP server process and reset on restart. |
| `roam_side_effects` | Classify symbols by side-effect bucket: ``none`` (pure), ``io_read`` (disk / network / DB read), ``io_write`` (disk / network / DB write), ``mutation`` (global / module state mutation), ``process`` (subprocess / thread / async), or ``unknown``. Coarse five-bucket taxonomy designed for agent decisions. Different from ``roam_effects`` (finer 11-kind taxonomy + transitive propagation) -- this is the agent's go/no-go classifier for ``can I retry this safely?``. |

| `roam_simulate_departure` | Simulate knowledge loss if a developer leaves the team. |
| `roam_sketch` | Render a compact structural skeleton of a directory: every file's exported symbols with kind, signature, line range, and first-line docstring. Different from ``roam_understand`` (broader project overview) and ``roam_file_info`` (one-file skeleton) -- this is the directory-level API surface in a single view, with optional ``full=True`` to include private symbols. |
| `roam_smells` | Run 24 deterministic code-smell detectors over the indexed codebase: brain methods, god classes, deep nesting, shotgun surgery, feature envy, long parameter lists, large classes, dead params, low cohesion, message chains, data clumps, type switches, cross-layer clones, parallel hierarchies, and more. Different from ``roam_vibe_check`` (AI-rot pattern regex) and ``roam_patterns`` (positive design patterns) -- this surfaces negative structural anti-patterns from DB queries. |
| `roam_spectral` | Spectral bisection: Fiedler vector partition tree and modularity gap. |
| `roam_split` | Analyse a file's internal call / reference graph and propose natural decomposition groups via Louvain community detection. Reports per-group isolation %, internal vs cross-group edges, and ranked extraction candidates (groups with >=3 symbols and >=50% isolation). Different from ``roam_clusters`` (repo-wide module partitioning) -- this analyses ONE file's internal seams. |
| `roam_stale_refs` | Find dangling file references — markdown links / HTML href-src / backtick paths whose target is missing. v12.48 adds anchor validation, confidence-tagged hints, --diff branch filter, --fix preview/apply, and --sort-by ranking. Set enrich_with_llm=True for LLM-sampled hints on findings the deterministic providers couldn't resolve. |
| `roam_stats` | Aggregate high-level statistics: language / role / kind counts plus a recent-commit activity counter over a configurable window. Different from ``roam_metrics`` (per-symbol static-metric report) and ``roam_graph_stats`` (graph-wide topology stats) -- this is the language-and-role inventory snapshot. |

| `roam_symbol` | Symbol definition, callers, callees, PageRank, fan-in/out metrics. |
| `roam_syntax_check` | Tree-sitter syntax validation. Finds ERROR/MISSING AST nodes. No index needed. |
| `roam_taint` | Graph-reach taint analysis. Returns OpenVEX-shaped findings (spec-legal status + justification — never `code_not_reachable`). 10 starter rule packs: sqli, xss, ssrf, path-traversal, command-injection, deserialization, open-redirect, urllib, socketio, fileupload. Pair with --ci to gate on findings (exit 5). |
| `roam_taint_classify` | Run `roam taint` then ask the agent's own LLM (via MCP sampling) to classify each reachable finding as IDOR/AUTHZ/SQLI/XSS/CMD_INJECTION/etc. with confidence + reasoning. Counter to Semgrep Multimodal — same LLM-reasoning narrative without a hosted API key. |
| `roam_test_gaps` | Find changed symbols missing test coverage, ranked by severity. |
| `roam_test_hermeticity` | Detect non-hermetic test patterns that cause CI flakiness. Six closed-enum kinds: network, time, random, filesystem, env, subprocess. AST-driven (not regex) with module-level suppression for monkeypatch / freezegun / responses / random.seed. |
| `roam_test_impact` | Tests transitively reachable from changed symbols — sharper scope than affected_tests. |
| `roam_test_map` | Map a symbol or file to its current test coverage: direct test edges (test file calls the symbol), file-level importers (test file imports the symbol's module), and convention-based matches (Salesforce ``<Name>Test`` / ``<Name>_Test`` classes). Different from ``roam_test_gaps`` (untested symbols in changed files) and ``roam_affected_tests`` (forward trace from changes to affected tests) -- this is the lookup for what currently exercises a given symbol. |
| `roam_test_pyramid` | Count indexed test files by kind (unit / integration / e2e / smoke / unknown) using path and name conventions, and flag inverted pyramids (when ``e2e + integration > unit``). Different from ``roam_test_gaps`` (missing coverage) -- this measures the shape of the existing test suite for slow-CI risk. |
| `roam_test_scaffold` | Generate a test-file skeleton for a source file or symbol (functions, classes, methods) with the right imports and per-symbol stub blocks. Supports pytest / unittest (Python), jest / mocha / vitest (JS/TS), Go testing, JUnit4 / JUnit5 (Java), and RSpec / Minitest (Ruby). Dry-run by default; pair with ``roam_test_map`` first to confirm no existing coverage. Skips symbols that already have tests in the target file. |
| `roam_timeline` | Chronological commits that touched the file owning a symbol — author, date, lines added/removed. |
| `roam_tour` | Codebase onboarding guide: reading order, entry points, architecture roles. |
| `roam_trace` | Shortest dependency path between two symbols with hop details. |
| `roam_trends` | Historical metric tracking: record and query health metric trends over time. |
| `roam_tx_boundaries` | Classify functions by transactional safety: ``transactional`` (begin matched by commit/rollback, all mutations inside scope), ``partial_transactional`` (mutations both inside AND outside scope), ``unsafe_mutation`` (mutations OUTSIDE any transaction wrapper -- latent bug), ``unmatched_begin`` (begin without commit/rollback -- leak), ``unmatched_commit``, ``non_transactional``, or ``unknown``. Composes on top of ``roam_side_effects``. Different from ``roam_idempotency`` (retry safety) -- this gates transaction correctness. |
| `roam_understand` | Codebase briefing in one call. Returns stack + architecture layers + entry points + hotspots + conventions in ~2-4K tokens. Triggers: 'what is this repo?', 'where do I start?', 'give me the lay of the land'. Run this FIRST in an unfamiliar repo — Glob/Grep around comes later. |
| `roam_uses` | Use for: 'who calls X?' / 'where is Y referenced?' / 'what breaks if I rename Z?'. Pick over multi-pattern grep — graph-resolved callers, importers, and subclasses grouped by edge type, zero comment/string-literal false positives. For 3+ symbols use roam_batch_get; for counts only, roam_impact. |

| `roam_why` | Explain why a symbol matters: role classification (Hub/Bridge/Leaf), transitive reach, critical-path membership, cluster cohesion, and a one-line verdict. Accepts multiple symbol names for batch triage. Different from ``roam_fan`` (raw connectivity ranking) and ``roam_preflight`` (blast-radius gate before edit) -- this is the per-symbol role explainer for triage and onboarding. |

| `roam_why_slow` | Rank runtime hotspots by cost = log10(call_count + 1) * p99_latency_ms. Reads ``runtime_stats`` populated by ``roam ingest-trace``. Optionally restricts to symbols in changed files vs a base ref. Different from ``roam_hotspots`` (static-vs-runtime classification) -- this is the pure latency-weighted ranking. |
| `roam_workflow` | Inspect a workflow recipe DAG, list available recipes, or suggest what to run next given a prior command. Useful as an agent navigation aid: 'I just ran roam impact -- what should I run next?' Different from the heavyweight analytical recipes -- this is the metadata-only recipe browser. |
