# Codewhale Computer Use

## Computers first

The plugin controls **computers**, not "the screen". `computer_list` shows the
registry; one computer is always **active**, and every tool acts on the active
computer unless given `computer`.

- Pass `computer: "<id>"` on any tool to act on (and stickily switch to) that
  computer. `computer_switch` changes the active computer without acting.
- `local` is the machine the plugin runs on. `ssh` computers run the bundled
  remote agent (pushed automatically at registration). `hdc` computers are
  HarmonyOS devices driven over hdc.
- Every receipt names the computer it happened on. Read it before continuing —
  never assume the action landed on the machine you meant.

## Core loop

Observe once, act once, then verify.

1. If readiness is unknown, call `request_access` once. It names missing
   permissions and missing tools per platform, and never pops dialogs. Its
   `via` field says who holds the permissions: `"app"` means the Codewhale
   Computer Use desktop app is doing the work (grants belong to it);
   `"direct"` means the hosting app or terminal is. Follow the actual
   `appHint`: bundled Codewhale builds already carry their native helper.
2. `list_apps` shows running apps only. If the user names an app that is
   absent, call `open_application` once with the original user-provided name,
   copied character-for-character — including case, spaces, punctuation, and
   suffixes such as `app` or `.exe`. Do not translate, localize, normalize,
   shorten, or retry with guesses.
3. `get_app_state` defaults to a text-first summary (macOS AX / Windows
   UIA / Linux AT-SPI / HarmonyOS uitest) with controls, values, actions,
   layout, element indices and a `state_id`. Start here without a screenshot,
   whether or not the model supports vision. Use `detail:"full"` for nested
   menus and tree structure; `compact` remains a summary alias. Missing labels
   or values mean unknown content, not something to guess.
4. If the tree contains the target, act on the element: `perform_action`
   (AXPress/Invoke/click…), `set_value` for editable fields, element click.
   The element path is background-safe on macOS and UIA platforms.
5. When accessibility cannot read visible text, macOS supports
   `get_app_state({app_ref, include_ocr:true})`. This explicitly captures the
   selected app window and recognizes text locally, without a vision model or
   remote service. Check `ocr.status`; recognized blocks include confidence,
   pixel bounds and ready-to-use coordinate targets. OCR text is not a control
   role or an advertised action. Verify uncertain text and observe again after
   changes. Other platforms return an explicit unavailable status while keeping
   their accessibility state usable. A text-only model must not infer unlabeled
   icons, charts or other graphical meaning from OCR or a screenshot file path.
   With vision, when accessibility cannot express the target: `screenshot` (optionally
   `zoom` for small targets) and act with a coordinate target. Coordinates are
   pixels **in the latest returned raster** for that computer; the server maps
   them to screen points. After a new screenshot, old pixels are stale.
   If the host reports an omitted or oversized image, capture a smaller app
   window/region or zoom, then use that returned raster. Do not guess from a
   file path or reuse coordinates from an image the model never received.
6. Verify with a fresh observation or a task oracle before claiming success.
   `action_sent: true` means it may already have happened — never replay.
   On macOS `type` also reports `verified`: `false` (with
   `verification_required: "screenshot"`) means the focused control's value
   did not reflect the text, so confirm with a screenshot before relying on
   the input.

## Choosing targets

- Element: `{"type":"element","state_id":"s-1","index":4}` — prefer this.
  Elements are revalidated against the live tree before every action: if the
  element moved, the click lands on its fresh center and the receipt carries
  `target_reacquired: true`; if it no longer resolves (or changed role) the
  call fails `element_stale` — call `get_app_state` again for a fresh
  `state_id`. A `state_id` only works on the computer that issued it
  (`state_wrong_computer`).
- Coordinate: `{"type":"coordinate","x":496,"y":331}` — pixels from the latest
  raster only; submit `x`/`y` unchanged, never transform them yourself.
  `zoom` returns a bindable raster of its own: after zooming, coordinates are
  pixels in the zoomed image. Points outside the bound raster fail
  `target_outside_raster` instead of landing somewhere unintended.
- Never translate pixels into an element target; never invent `state_id`s.

## Raw input reality (read before clicking)

- macOS: call `open_application` with `activate:false` to bind input to the
  intended process, even when the app is already running; pass `pid` when two
  processes share a bundle id. Then the two halves behave differently:
  - **Keyboard and element actions are quiet.** `type`, `key`, `set_value`,
    `select_text` and `perform_action` reach the bound process without moving
    the pointer or changing the foreground. Prefer them.
  - **Background mode never takes the shared pointer.** A coordinate
    `left_click` first tries the bound application's accessibility press.
    Without one, or for raw double/triple/right/middle click, drag, hover or
    scroll, it fails with `shared_pointer_required` before moving the cursor.
    Use another advertised accessibility action or a separate computer.
  - Shared-desktop gestures and foreground keyboard delivery require explicit
    user authorization for exclusive desktop use, followed by
    `open_application(activate:true)`. Do not select it merely to work around a
    background refusal. Receipts identify `input_scope: "shared-desktop"`;
    pointer gestures use the physical cursor, even if it is restored afterward.
    Keys are `foreground-guarded` and stop when another app takes focus. Never
    keep reactivating after the user takes control; return to `activate:false`
    when the shared-desktop step ends.
  - Menus appear in `get_app_state`. Use the advertised action (often
    `AXPress` to open a menu, then `AXPick` on its item), then observe again.
  - A pointer gesture is refused when another application's window covers the
    point; it names the owner. Observe again and use the selected control's
    accessibility action, or wait for authorized exclusive desktop use. Do not
    move or close the reported window.
  - An accessibility press refuses to cross a modal sheet
    (`window_blocked_by_modal_sheet`): deal with the sheet first.
  Use app-scoped screenshots (`app_ref`) to avoid capturing unrelated windows.
  Watching the preview does not authorize shared-desktop control. Enable it
  only when the user asks to watch; disable it when finished. The preview is a
  local app view, not an isolated desktop. Process-directed actions still
  change the target app: do not work in an app the user is actively editing.
  Close only disposable documents created by your task; never quit a user app.
- Windows/Linux: raw input is foreground by nature; UIA/AT-SPI element actions
  are the precise path.
- HarmonyOS: `uitest` synthesizes touches; there is no hover or cursor.

## Keyboard

- macOS uses `cmd` (`cmd+c`), Linux/Windows use `ctrl` (`ctrl+c`).
- `key` for chords and repeats, `hold_key` for a duration, `type` for text.
- Prefer `set_value` on editable elements over typing.

## Recording

`recording_start` → work → `recording_stop` returns the finalized file path.
macOS uses ScreenCaptureKit inside the signed helper — no system recorder UI
and no desktop dimming overlay (a receipt warning about Screen Recording
permission means the user must grant it once). Linux and Windows recording is
unavailable pending session-owned cleanup; use screenshots. HarmonyOS uses
snapshot-series (no native CLI recorder —
the receipt says so). `recording_status` / `recording_list` report bytes and
paths. Screenshots land in the same directory.

## Safety

- `stop_computer_control` is the kill switch; after it, actions fail closed
  for the session. Do not continue after it or after a denied permission.
- Never retry a refused action unchanged. Re-observe, choose a fresh target.
- If a permission is explicitly denied, tell the user which permission in
  which Settings pane, and end the turn. Do not promise later retries.

## Recipes

- **Screenshot** — optionally a computer id, display index, or `[x,y,w,h]`
  region; call `screenshot`; report path, size, computer/display. Black or
  empty capture means Screen Recording permission is missing (macOS) for the
  app (`via: "app"`) or the host terminal (`via: "direct"`): say which and
  stop.
- **Record** — `recording_start` (parse computer id, fps, display, duration
  or "record for 30s" → `durationSec` on macOS), then report id, path, mode.
  To stop, find the running id via `recording_list` and call `recording_stop`.
- **Switch computers** — `computer_list`; if asked to add: ssh `user@host`
  (agent is pushed automatically) or `hdc [target]` for a HarmonyOS device;
  otherwise show the registry and remind that any tool accepts `computer`.
- **Status** — `computer_list`, then `request_access` per computer; call out
  anything that will fail closed with the exact install hint from the receipt.
