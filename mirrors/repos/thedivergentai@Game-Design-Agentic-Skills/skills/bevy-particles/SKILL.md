# Bevy particles (docs-first stub)

Not a full port. Docs-first stub. Godot counterpart: godot-particles.

## When to use

Load this before adding a burst, trail, or GPU particle effect so the gap is explicit. Do not invent a particle plugin.

## ECS shape

- **Components** would own emitter settings once a particle type exists. None was on the crate index.
- **Resources:** none named for particles.
- **Systems:** none named.
- **Schedule:** a future emitter would run on `Update` or a fixed step. That is a placement note, not an API.

## Godot idea to Bevy idiom

| Idea | Bevy idiom (idea only) |
| --- | --- |
| CPU particles | Unverified. No particle module in the 0.20.0 module list. |
| GPU particles | Unverified. Same gap. |
| One-shot burst | Your own timer component until a particle page is opened. |

## Gaps

- The opened `bevy` 0.20.0 module and feature lists have no particle feature and no particle module.
- No third-party particle crate was selected from the assets page.


## Expert Knowledge Delta

Library target in prose: **Bevy 0.20.0**. Lattice URLs stay unversioned.

Opened canon only: `Component`, `Resource`, `Query`, `Commands`, `Startup`, `Update`, `Fixed` / `FixedMain` (`bevy::time`), `.chain()`, `Plugin`, `DefaultPlugins`, `MinimalPlugins`. Messages and observers are an ownership slot. This file does not invent their struct APIs. Systems run in parallel unless `.chain()` orders the ones that conflict.

### Who owns state

| Piece | Owner | Who may mutate | Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data on one entity | `Component` | One system via `Query` | `Update` or `FixedMain` |
| One value for the whole app | `Resource` | One system | `Startup` to insert, then the schedule that reads it |
| Spawn | `Commands` | The spawning system | `Startup` for the initial world; later schedules for runtime spawn |
| Order that must not race | `.chain()` | The chained systems only | Same schedule |
| Plugin boundary | `Plugin` | `build` registers systems and resources | Before the app runs |

Borrow rule: two systems that both mutably query the same component must be ordered (`.chain()`) or split so only one writes. Unrelated systems stay parallel. That is the ECS page rule, not a guess at a system-set API.

### Decision

| If you need | Do this | Do not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-entity data | `Component` + `Query` | A Godot node script |
| App-wide config or clock | `Resource` | Copy the value onto every entity |
| Stable simulation step | `FixedMain` and the `Fixed` clock | Tie simulation to raw frame `Update` |
| Startup spawn | `Commands` in `Startup` | Spawn from a render system |
| Cross-system notice that is not shared state | Message or observer slot in `bevy-events-messaging` | A new event type invented in this file |
| An API this skill did not open | A Gaps row | A fabricated crate (solver, navmesh module, net, XR) |

Load `references/a-gate-notes.md` for the same table plus the gap rule.

## NEVER

- Do not put `/0.20.0/` in lattice URLs. WHY: permalinks stay on `latest`. The 0.20.0 pin belongs in prose once.
- Do not mutably query the same component from two unordered systems. WHY: the schedule runs systems in parallel unless `.chain()` orders them.
- Do not invent a physics, navigation, networking, or XR crate here. WHY: those rows are gaps, blocked, or revisit.

- No Godot particle node types. WHY: a Godot port, an unopened API, or a public lie fails the docs-first bar.
- No named particle crate as the chosen solution. WHY: a Godot port, an unopened API, or a public lie fails the docs-first bar.

- No Godot types in Bevy code. WHY: a Godot port, an unopened API, or a public lie fails the docs-first bar.
- No invented APIs or unnamed third-party crates as the chosen solver. WHY: a Godot port, an unopened API, or a public lie fails the docs-first bar.
- No Creation Station content. WHY: a Godot port, an unopened API, or a public lie fails the docs-first bar.
- No umbrella skill over Godot and Bevy. WHY: a Godot port, an unopened API, or a public lie fails the docs-first bar.
- Do not mark this row `ported`. It is `docs_mapped`. WHY: a Godot port, an unopened API, or a public lie fails the docs-first bar.

docs.rs links use the unversioned `latest` permalink. The library pin on bevy-master stays **0.20.0**.
