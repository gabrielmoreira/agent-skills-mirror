  Adding an LLM provider to RedAmon: the credential boundary (keys must never
  reach scan containers), prefix-routed model ids, and the provider registry. A
  misrouted model id or a leaked key are the two failures this guards.
  Trigger: adding or editing an LLM provider; editing parse_model_provider in
  agentic/orchestrator_helpers/llm_setup.py, the webapp provider-type registry,
  the user_llm_providers model, or an LLM call site that passes an API key; a
  non-chat provider type (TypeSafe Jev) or a path that picks "any provider row".

## When to Use

- Adding a new LLM provider (OpenAI-compatible or otherwise) the agent can use.

For a non-LLM external API *tool*, use `agentic-tool-integration`.

---

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER let a provider API key reach a scan container.** Keys live in exactly
  two places: Postgres `user_llm_providers` rows and, in transit, on the wire
  between webapp and agent. The recon / scan / MCP containers must **never** see
  them. Do not thread a provider key through recon settings or container env.
- **NEVER add a model id that is not prefix-routed.** Anything other than
  `claude-*` and bare OpenAI ids MUST carry a `provider/<model>` prefix, resolved by
  `parse_model_provider()` at
  [agentic/orchestrator_helpers/llm_setup.py:67](../../agentic/orchestrator_helpers/llm_setup.py#L67).
  An unprefixed id routes to the wrong provider silently.
- **NEVER treat every `user_llm_providers` row as a chat LLM.** A non-chat type
  (today `jev`, the TypeSafe decision API) must be skipped by every path that
  builds a chat model, or its token is sent to the wrong host: `setup_llm`'s
  custom branch builds `ChatOpenAI(api_key=<row key>)` with no base URL, which is
  api.openai.com. Add the type to `NON_CHAT_PROVIDER_TYPES` in BOTH twins
  (`agentic/llm_builder.py`, `webapp/src/lib/llmProviderKinds.ts`); use
  `chat_providers()` / `isChatProvider` wherever rows are listed, counted, gated
  or forwarded (the `/api/models` forward, the project LLM gate, the triage
  preflight, the feature-model grid); and never let a stale `custom/<id>` fall
  back to "the first provider" (`custom_provider_or_fallback` falls back only to
  custom-capable types). `setup_llm` also refuses a non-chat type outright.
- **A non-chat provider's endpoint is a constant, and its type is locked.**
  `agentic/jev_client.py` is the only code that talks to `api.typesafe.ai`: a fixed
  base URL, no redirects, fixed error texts. On the webapp, POST forces model,
  URL and headers and allows one row per user; PUT and the test route refuse a
  type change in either direction and ignore a body-supplied URL/headers for a
  stored row, so a stored token can never be re-pointed at another host.
- **ALWAYS register the provider in the webapp provider-type registry** and
  **propagate the key kwarg into every LLM call site.** A provider registered but
  not propagated builds a client with no credentials. The guide enumerates all
  11 integration points; touch each.

## The two invariants

| Invariant | Where | Failure if broken |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keys only in Postgres + webapp<->agent transit | [webapp/prisma/schema.prisma](../../webapp/prisma/schema.prisma) `user_llm_providers`; agent settings fetch | key leaks into scan/MCP containers |
| Model id prefix routing | `parse_model_provider()` [llm_setup.py:67](../../agentic/orchestrator_helpers/llm_setup.py#L67) | model routes to the wrong provider |

## Commands

```bash
docker compose build agent && docker compose up -d agent   # agentic/ is baked
docker compose exec webapp npx prisma db push              # provider schema changes (NEVER prisma migrate)
```
