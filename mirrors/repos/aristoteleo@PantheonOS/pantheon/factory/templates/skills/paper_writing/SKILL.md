# Paper Writing Skills

Resources for the Paper Write Team's reporter agent. Each template is a
self-contained markdown file with the full HTML+CSS or LaTeX content.

## Templates

| Template | File | Style | Use Case |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| `report_standard` | [report_standard.md](./report_standard.md) | Professional report (Manus-style), HTML+CSS | Default for all reports |
| `report_academic` | [report_academic.md](./report_academic.md) | Formal academic paper, HTML+CSS | HTML preview for academic papers |
| `latex_cn` | [latex_cn.md](./latex_cn.md) | Chinese academic paper, LaTeX | Chinese academic PDF via Tectonic |
| `latex_en` | [latex_en.md](./latex_en.md) | English academic paper, LaTeX | English academic PDF via Tectonic |

## How to Use

### Report style (default)

1. Reporter reads this skill index
2. Reporter reads `report_standard.md` — contains both the HTML template and CSS
3. Reporter reads paper.md, parses frontmatter, converts Markdown body to HTML
4. Reporter fills the HTML template with metadata + CSS + content
5. Reporter writes the final HTML file
6. The UI exports the HTML to PDF on user request (browser print-to-PDF using the `@media print` CSS rules)

### Academic style

1. Reporter reads this skill index
2. Reporter reads the LaTeX template (`latex_cn.md` or `latex_en.md` based on lang)
3. Reporter reads paper.md, parses frontmatter, converts Markdown body to LaTeX
4. Reporter fills the LaTeX template with metadata + content, writes .tex file
5. Reporter runs Tectonic to compile PDF
6. Reporter also reads `report_academic.md` to generate an HTML preview

### Custom templates

Users can add their own `.md` template files to this directory following the
same format (frontmatter + HTML/CSS or LaTeX in code blocks).
