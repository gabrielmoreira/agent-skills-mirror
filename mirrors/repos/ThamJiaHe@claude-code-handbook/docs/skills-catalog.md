## How Skills Work

Skills are markdown instruction files that teach Claude specific workflows. They cost **~5 tokens** until activated (vs MCP's ~42.6K), then load full instructions on demand via progressive disclosure.

```
~/.claude/skills/my-skill.md     # Personal skill
project/.claude/skills/skill.md  # Project skill
```

Skills are invoked via the `/skill-name` slash command or automatically triggered by matching prompts.
