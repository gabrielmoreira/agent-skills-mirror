# Lark Skill Index

This skill is a directory. Find the sub-skill that matches the user's intent, load it with `read_skills`, then proceed.
All sub-skills are pre-installed at `~/.agents/skills/`.

## Prerequisite: Load lark-shared First

Before any Lark operation, load `lark-shared` first — it covers CLI initialization, identity switching (user/bot), scope management, and common error handling.

```
read_skills(skill_names=["lark-shared"])
```
