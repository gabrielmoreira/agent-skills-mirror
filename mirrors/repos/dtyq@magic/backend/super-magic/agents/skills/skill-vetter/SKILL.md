# Skill Vetter

Security-first vetting protocol for AI agent skills. **Never install a skill without vetting it first.**

## When to Use

- Before installing any skill from the platform skill market
- Before installing external skills from skillhub
- Before running skills from GitHub repositories
- When evaluating skills shared by other agents
- Anytime you are asked to install unknown code

---

## Vetting Protocol

### Step 1: Source Check

Questions to answer:
- Where did this skill come from? (platform market / skillhub / GitHub / other)
- Is the author known or reputable?
- How many downloads or stars does it have?
- When was it last updated?
- Are there reviews from other agents?

### Step 2: Preview Install to Temp Dir, Then Read All Files

**Do not install to the real skills directory yet. Install to a temp directory first for inspection.**

Choose the preview method based on the source:

**skillhub source** (supports `--dir` for temp directory):

```bash
skillhub --dir /tmp/skillhub-preview/ install <slug>
```

After install, use `shell_exec` to list and read all files:

```bash
# List all files
shell_exec(command="find /tmp/skillhub-preview/<skill-name> -type f | sort")

# Read each file
shell_exec(command="cat /tmp/skillhub-preview/<skill-name>/SKILL.md")
shell_exec(command="cat /tmp/skillhub-preview/<skill-name>/scripts/<file>.py")
# ... read all scripts, configs, and reference files
```

If approved, run the normal install without `--dir`. Either way, clean up the temp dir:

```bash
shell_exec(command="rm -rf /tmp/skillhub-preview/")
```

**Platform market / my skill library source** (also supports `--dir` for temp directory):

```bash
shell_exec(command="skillhub install-platform-me <code> --dir /tmp/skillhub-preview/")
# or
shell_exec(command="skillhub install-platform-market <code> --dir /tmp/skillhub-preview/")
```

After install, use `shell_exec` to list and read all files:

```bash
# List all files
shell_exec(command="find /tmp/skillhub-preview/<skill-name> -type f | sort")

# Read each file
shell_exec(command="cat /tmp/skillhub-preview/<skill-name>/SKILL.md")
shell_exec(command="cat /tmp/skillhub-preview/<skill-name>/scripts/<file>.py")
# ... read all files
```

If approved, run the normal install without `--dir`. Either way, clean up the temp dir:

```bash
shell_exec(command="rm -rf /tmp/skillhub-preview/")
```

### Step 3: Code Review (MANDATORY)

Read ALL files in the skill. Reject immediately if any of the following are present:

```
REJECT IMMEDIATELY IF YOU SEE:
─────────────────────────────────────────
- curl/wget to unknown URLs
- Sends data to external servers
- Requests credentials, tokens, or API keys
- Reads ~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.config without clear reason
- Accesses MEMORY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md
- Uses base64 decode on anything
- Uses eval() or exec() with external input
- Modifies system files outside the workspace
- Installs packages without listing them explicitly
- Network calls to raw IP addresses instead of domains
- Obfuscated code (compressed, encoded, or minified)
- Requests elevated or sudo permissions
- Accesses browser cookies or sessions
- Touches credential files
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Step 4: Permission Scope

Evaluate:
- What files does it need to read?
- What files does it need to write?
- What commands does it run?
- Does it need network access? To where?
- Is the scope minimal for its stated purpose?

### Step 5: Risk Classification

| Risk Level | Examples | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| LOW | Notes, weather, formatting | Basic review, install OK |
| MEDIUM | File ops, browser, external APIs | Full code review required |
| HIGH | Credentials, trading, system commands | Human approval required |
| EXTREME | Security configs, root access | Do NOT install |

## Output Format

After vetting, produce this report:

```
SKILL VETTING REPORT
=======================================
Skill: [name]
Source: [platform market / skillhub / GitHub / other]
Author: [username]
Version: [version]
---------------------------------------
METRICS:
- Downloads/Stars: [count]
- Last Updated: [date]
- Files Reviewed: [count]
---------------------------------------
RED FLAGS: [None / list them]

PERMISSIONS NEEDED:
- Files: [list or "None"]
- Network: [list or "None"]
- Commands: [list or "None"]
---------------------------------------
RISK LEVEL: [LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / EXTREME]

VERDICT: [SAFE TO INSTALL / INSTALL WITH CAUTION / DO NOT INSTALL]

NOTES: [Any observations]
=======================================
```

## Trust Hierarchy

1. **Official platform skills** (published via platform market) — lower scrutiny (still review)
2. **High-star repos (1000+)** — moderate scrutiny
3. **Known authors** — moderate scrutiny
4. **New or unknown sources** — maximum scrutiny
5. **Skills requesting credentials** — human approval always required

---

## Principles

- No skill is worth compromising security
- When in doubt, do not install
- Escalate high-risk decisions to the user
- Document what you vet for future reference
