# DingTalk CLI Skill Index

**Before doing anything**, you MUST load the `dws` skill first. It contains the full product reference, command syntax, intent routing decision tree, dangerous operation rules, and error handling guide. Do not proceed without reading it.

## Authentication

Before any DingTalk operation, verify auth status first:

```bash
dws auth status --format json
```

If `authenticated` is `false`, start the login flow. This environment has no browser (Docker/SSH), so always use the device flow:

```bash
dws auth login --device
```

The command outputs an authorization URL, then waits with the prompt `Waiting for user authorization`. At this point:
1. Show the authorization URL to the user
2. Ask the user to open the URL in a browser or DingTalk mobile app to complete authorization
3. The command will automatically detect the authorization and proceed

To force re-login (e.g. token expired):

```bash
dws auth login --device --force
```

## When Unsure About a Command

Always check `--help` before guessing parameters.

```bash
dws --help
dws <product> --help
dws <product> <command> --help
```

Examples:

```bash
dws chat --help
dws calendar event list --help
dws aitable record --help
```
