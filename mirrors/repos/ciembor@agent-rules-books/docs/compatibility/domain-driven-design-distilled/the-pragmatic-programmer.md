# Domain-Driven Design Distilled vs The Pragmatic Programmer

Status: reviewed
Research basis: mini-only

Verdict: ✅ Complementary

Conflict: 14%
Overlap: 38%
Complementarity: 74%

## Loading Decision

Use together when domain language, invariants, lifecycle, or Bounded Contexts affect the task and the other rule set governs implementation quality, reliability, data, or safe change.

## Book A Pressure

- Domain-Driven Design Distilled should drive tasks where selective DDD, subdomain importance, Bounded Contexts, local language, and justified tactical patterns dominate.
- Evidence: `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 3-5: applies when business software has domain complexity, language ambiguity, strategic differentiation, or integration risk but needs smallest effective DDD rather than ceremony.

## Book B Pressure

- The Pragmatic Programmer should drive tasks where ownership, DRY knowledge, orthogonality, reversibility, tracer feedback, automation, and contracts dominate.
- Evidence: `the-pragmatic-programmer/the-pragmatic-programmer.mini.md` lines 3-5: applies as a general engineering operating style for accountable delivery, adaptability, fast feedback, and easy-to-change code.

## Complementary Forces

- Claim: Domain-Driven Design Distilled contributes selective-DDD, subdomain, Bounded-Context, local-language, and justified-pattern pressure; The Pragmatic Programmer contributes ownership, DRY-knowledge, orthogonality, reversibility, tracer-feedback, automation, and contract pressure. Together they are useful only where both scopes are active.
- Evidence:
  - `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 13-30: requires capability/subdomain/context/language first, Core Domain investment, selective DDD, explicit Bounded Context ownership, term translation, deliberate context relationships, integration style by coupling/failure semantics, separate integration contracts, local domain terms, justified Entities/Value Objects/Aggregates/Domain Events/Application Services, infrastructure-free domain model, code that teaches the model, timeboxed modeling aids, and planning from modeling uncertainty.
  - `the-pragmatic-programmer/the-pragmatic-programmer.mini.md` lines 13-35: requires pragmatic non-dogmatic choices, ownership of risks, future maintenance awareness, one authoritative knowledge representation, orthogonality, reversible volatile decisions, useful domain vocabulary, tracer bullets, prototypes, real requirements, automation, feedback loops, explicit contracts/failure categories/resource ownership, plain text/open formats, visible shared state/async costs, understood tooling, fact-based debugging, small increments, communicative artifacts, team responsibility, and broken-window containment.

## Overlap

- Claim: They overlap where both affect boundaries, explicit responsibilities, tests, coupling reduction, and avoiding hidden assumptions; the overlap score reflects how often an agent would receive similar pressure from both.
- Evidence:
  - `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 48-56: checks subdomain investment, explicit context relationship, visible Ubiquitous Language, tested translations, justified tactical patterns, small Aggregates, coordinating application services, infrastructure-free domain model, and captured modeling discoveries.
  - `the-pragmatic-programmer/the-pragmatic-programmer.mini.md` lines 56-65: checks authoritative knowledge, independent concerns and reversible choices, feedback, accepted prototype/tool behavior, contracts/failures/resources, visible state/coupling, automation, relevant tests, communicative artifacts, and touched-area improvement/containment.

## Conflicts

- Claim: The tension is DDD ceremony: tactical patterns must protect model meaning and should not displace the other rule set's simpler construction, refactoring, data, or operational constraints.
- Evidence:
  - `domain-driven-design-distilled/domain-driven-design-distilled.mini.md` lines 7-9: corrects starting from tactical patterns, frameworks, persistence, APIs, or class shapes before business capability, subdomain, context, and language.
  - `the-pragmatic-programmer/the-pragmatic-programmer.mini.md` lines 13-35: requires pragmatic non-dogmatic choices, ownership of risks, future maintenance awareness, one authoritative knowledge representation, orthogonality, reversible volatile decisions, useful domain vocabulary, tracer bullets, prototypes, real requirements, automation, feedback loops, explicit contracts/failure categories/resource ownership, plain text/open formats, visible shared state/async costs, understood tooling, fact-based debugging, small increments, communicative artifacts, team responsibility, and broken-window containment.

## Use Together When

- Use together when one change simultaneously involves selective DDD, subdomain importance, local language, and justified tactical patterns and ownership, DRY knowledge, orthogonality, feedback, automation, contracts, and pragmatic stopping points; otherwise load only the rule set whose trigger is actually present.

## Prefer One When

- Prefer the DDD rule set when language, lifecycle, invariants, or context boundaries drive design; prefer the other book for tasks without visible domain-model pressure.
