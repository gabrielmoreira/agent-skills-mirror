Complementarity: 78%

## Loading Decision

Use together when the task has production boundaries plus Implementing Domain-Driven Design design pressure: preserve the code/model shape while adding timeouts, retries, isolation, limits, and observability only where triggered.

## Book A Pressure

- Implementing Domain-Driven Design should drive tasks where DDD implementation choices around contexts, aggregates, repositories, events, services, and translations dominate.
- Evidence: `implementing-domain-driven-design/implementing-domain-driven-design.mini.md` lines 3-5: applies when DDD implementation choices affect contexts, language, aggregates, repositories, events, application services, package structure, or cross-context integration.

## Book B Pressure

- Release It! should drive tasks where production failure semantics, demand limits, timeouts, retries, isolation, observability, and recovery dominate.
- Evidence: `release-it/release-it.mini.md` lines 3-5: applies to services, APIs, jobs, queues, deployment paths, control tooling, and critical flows that must survive production failures and operational mistakes.

## Complementary Forces

- Claim: Implementing Domain-Driven Design contributes implementation-level DDD pressure around contexts, aggregates, repositories, events, services, and translation; Release It! contributes production-failure, demand-limit, timeout, retry, isolation, observability, and recovery pressure. Together they are useful only where both scopes are active.
- Evidence:
  - `implementing-domain-driven-design/implementing-domain-driven-design.mini.md` lines 13-31: requires context-first interpretation, consistent local language, Core Domain protection, explicit context interactions and translations, small invariant-driven Aggregates with identity references, Entities/Value Objects/Domain Services/Repositories/Domain Events/Event Sourcing/Application Services by rule, Bounded Context modules, DTO/projection/query separation, CQRS where justified, model-walk code generation, and direct domain/boundary tests.
  - `release-it/release-it.mini.md` lines 13-27: requires production failure assumptions, visible failure/limited blast radius/load shedding, operational concerns as part of the system, explicit time limits, safe bounded retries, isolation patterns, overload behavior, stability patterns, validated runtime/operational state, scarce-resource budgeting, untrusted external input, boundary observability, safe operational controls, production-aware interconnects/jobs/caches/contracts, security and bounded chaos/disaster testing.

## Overlap

- Claim: They overlap where both affect boundaries, explicit responsibilities, tests, coupling reduction, and avoiding hidden assumptions; the overlap score reflects how often an agent would receive similar pressure from both.
- Evidence:
  - `implementing-domain-driven-design/implementing-domain-driven-design.mini.md` lines 48-57: checks explicit context, consistent local terms, protected Core Domain, visible translations, small invariant-driven Aggregates, behavior-bearing Entities/Value Objects, aggregate-root repositories, meaningful events/event sourcing only when right, coordinating application services, and external representations outside the domain.
  - `release-it/release-it.mini.md` lines 41-48: checks timeouts, retry safety, bounded queues/pools/payloads, failure isolation, validated external inputs, diagnostic coverage, recoverable operational controls, and explicit production failure behavior.

## Conflicts

- Claim: The tension is mechanism cost: reliability patterns add complexity and must be scoped to real production failure modes rather than added to simple local code.
- Evidence:
  - `implementing-domain-driven-design/implementing-domain-driven-design.mini.md` lines 7-9: corrects renamed CRUD by requiring operational domain modeling inside an explicit context with local language, small invariant boundaries, identity references, and translation.
  - `release-it/release-it.mini.md` lines 31-37: fires on outbound calls, queues/buffers/pools/caches/jobs, deployment/config/startup/migrations/automation, health/load/service discovery, API contracts, incident/capacity reviews, admin/control/chaos work.

## Use Together When

- Use together when the other design concern touches services, APIs, jobs, queues, dependency calls, deployment paths, or critical flows that need explicit failure behavior.

## Prefer One When

- Prefer Release It when production failures, overload, timeouts, retries, dependencies, or observability dominate; prefer the other book for purely local design or construction work.

## Review Notes

- External context was not used as decisive evidence for Implementing Domain-Driven Design vs Release It!; the verdict is based on the cited local `mini` line ranges.
