Usage: playwright_server.sh [start|stop|status|reset|snapshot]

  start     Start the backend and frontend, wait until both answer, print the URL.
            Seeds the sandbox with .agents/playwright_project on first start.
            Already running is success, not an error.
  stop      Stop both.
  status    Report whether both are answering.
  reset     Stop, delete the sandbox, start again — a freshly seeded sandbox.
  snapshot  Capture the running sandbox's project back into
            .agents/playwright_project, to update the seed for future sessions.

Frontend $FRONTEND_URL, backend $BACKEND_URL. Override the ports with
KILN_DEV_FRONTEND_PORT / KILN_DEV_BACKEND_PORT, and the data directory with
KILN_DEV_HOME (default $WEB_UI_DIR/.agent_dev_home).
