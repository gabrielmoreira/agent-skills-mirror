# Observability — Run Ledger & Spend Caps

Two related surfaces: a durable record of every turn this runtime executes, and a
spend cap that is enforced by the runtime rather than by whichever CLI happens to
support a budget flag.

## Why

`getStats()` / `getCost()` describe a **live** session. They live in memory, and
per-session history is capped and evicted, so a restart erased everything except
the resume-id registry — there was no way to answer "what did we run today, on
which engine, for how much". The run ledger is that record.

The same gap made `maxBudgetUsd` a promise the runtime did not keep: it was only
ever translated into Claude Code's `--max-budget-usd` flag, so a council of Codex
agents ran with no cap at all. The cap is now applied in `SessionManager`, which
every engine passes through.

## The ledger

- Location: `~/.claw-orchestrator/runs/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (override with
  `CLAWO_RUNS_DIR`).
- One JSON object per line, one line per completed turn — **successful or not**.
- Shards are one file per UTC day. Queries always filter on the row timestamp, so
  the shard boundary is a storage detail; `--since 24h` spans midnight correctly.
- Writes are best-effort: a ledger failure is logged at `warn` and swallowed. It
  can never break the turn it is describing.
- Nothing prunes old shards. A row is roughly 250 bytes; delete shards yourself if
  you want the history gone.

### Row schema

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ts` | ISO timestamp of turn completion |
| `session` | SessionManager session name |
| `engine` | `claude` / `codex` / `codex-app` / `grok` / `opencode` / `agy` / `custom` |
| `model` | Configured model, or the engine's own reported model when none was set |
| `cwd` | Working directory the turn ran in |
| `turn` | 1-based turn index within the session |
| `tokensIn` / `tokensOut` / `cachedTokens` | **Per-turn deltas**, not session totals |
| `costUsd` | Per-turn delta in USD |
| `tokensEstimated` | `true` when the counts came from `estimateTokens()` (see below) |
| `durationMs` | Wall-clock for the turn |
| `toolCalls` / `toolErrors` | Per-turn deltas |
| `ok` | `false` for a turn that threw, or that the session's own `turnsSucceeded` counter did not count (see `sessions.md`). Falls back to "nothing was thrown" when the counter cannot be read |
| `error` | Failure text, truncated to 500 chars. Absent when the turn resolved but the engine did not count it as succeeded (an interrupted or non-SUCCESS turn), so a failed row does not always carry one |
| `parent` | council id / fanout id / autoloop run id, when the turn belongs to one |

Deltas rather than totals means summing a query window gives that window's spend
without double-counting.

Every path funnels through `SessionManager.sendMessage`, so council, fanout,
autoloop, ACP, the OpenAI-compatible bridge, the MCP server and the CLI are all
covered by the same hook. `parent` is what lets you reassemble a multi-agent run:

```bash
clawo runs --parent council-1a2b3c4d
```

### Reading it

```bash
clawo runs                                   # last 24h, table
clawo runs --since 7d --engine codex         # one engine, one week
clawo runs --session my-session --json       # raw rows + summary
clawo runs --parent fanout-b5f7c886          # every agent turn of one fan-out
```

Over HTTP (GET query string or POST JSON body):

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:18796/runs?since=24h&limit=200" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Returns `{ ok, rows, summary }`, where `summary` carries `rows`, `costUsd`,
`tokensIn`, `tokensOut`, `estimatedRows` and a per-engine breakdown. The dashboard
header shows the 24-hour figure from the same endpoint.

Programmatically: `manager.getRunLedger({ since, session, engine, parent, limit })`.

## Spend caps

Set `maxBudgetUsd` on a session (or on a council / fanout, which applies it per
agent). Before each turn the runtime compares the session's cumulative
`getCost().totalUsd` against the cap and refuses to send when it has been reached:

```
Budget exceeded for session "my-session" (codex): spent $1.2400 of $1.0000 cap.
Raise maxBudgetUsd or start a new session to continue.
```

The refusal is a typed `BudgetExceededError` carrying `session`, `engine`,
`spentUsd` and `capUsd`, and it happens **before** the engine is spawned.

Notes:

- The check is "has the cap been reached", not "would this turn exceed it" — a
  turn's cost is unknown until it finishes, so the last allowed turn can overshoot.
  Size the cap accordingly.
- A cap of `0` or a negative number means *unset*, not *refuse everything*.
- Claude Code still receives `--max-budget-usd` as well: an in-CLI stop happens
  earlier and therefore costs less than an after-the-fact refusal.
- `session_list` / `GET /session/list` expose `costUsd`, `budgetUsd` and
  `budgetExhausted` so a stalled session shows *why* it stopped taking turns.

## Accuracy: which engines report real usage

`costUsd` is derived from token counts times the model's price in `models.ts`.
Where the engine reports usage, those counts are the engine's own. Where it does
not, the wrapper falls back to `estimateTokens()` (characters ÷ 4) and the row is
flagged `tokensEstimated: true`; the CLI marks those costs with a trailing `~`.

| Engine | Token counts |
|---|---|
| `claude` | Engine-reported |
| `codex` | Engine-reported |
| `codex-app` | Engine-reported |
| `grok` | Engine-reported — and so is the **cost**: this engine reports `total_cost_usd`, which the wrapper passes through instead of pricing tokens from the registry, so registry drift cannot affect a grok row |
| `cursor` (legacy) | Engine-reported when the stream carries `usage`, else estimated |
| `opencode` | Engine-reported when the run JSON carries `tokens`, else estimated |
| `agy` | Engine-reported when the result event carries usage, else estimated |
| `custom` | Depends on the CLI; estimated when it emits no usage |

So on an estimating engine the cap is best-effort. It will stop a runaway session;
it is not an accounting guarantee, and it is not a substitute for the spend limits
your provider offers.

Cost figures are also only as good as the pricing table: a model missing from
`models.ts` prices at its family default, and subscription plans (Claude Max,
ChatGPT Pro) bill nothing per token while the ledger still reports the API-rate
equivalent. Read `costUsd` as "what this would cost at API rates".
