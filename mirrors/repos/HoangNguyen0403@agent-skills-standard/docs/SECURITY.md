## SkillSpector Verified

[![SkillSpector Verified](https://img.shields.io/badge/SkillSpector-Verified-76b900?logo=nvidia&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard/security/code-scanning)

All skills in this repository are automatically scanned by **[NVIDIA SkillSpector](https://github.com/nvidia/skillspector)** — a security scanner purpose-built for AI agent skills. A passing scan is required before any skill category can be published.
This repository is considered **Verified by SkillSpector** whenever the automated scan passes and the dated `skillspector-verified-vYYYYMMDD` tag is created on `main`.

## What We Scan For

SkillSpector checks **64 vulnerability patterns across 16 categories**:

| Category                  | Patterns | Key Risks                                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt Injection**      | 5        | Instruction overrides, hidden directives, behavior manipulation |
| **Data Exfiltration**     | 4        | External transmission, env variable harvesting, context leakage |
| **Privilege Escalation**  | 3        | Excessive permissions, sudo/root, credential access             |
| **Supply Chain**          | 6        | Dependency confusion, malicious updates, version pinning        |
| **Excessive Agency**      | 4        | Unauthorized actions, scope creep, autonomous decision-making   |
| **Output Handling**       | 3        | Unsanitized output, injection via responses                     |
| **System Prompt Leakage** | 3        | Revealing internal instructions                                 |

| **MCP Least Privilege**   | 3        | MCP tools requesting excessive permissions                      |

## Risk Score Threshold

| Score    | Status        | Meaning                                |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 0 – 25   | ✅ **PASS**   | Skills are safe to install             |
| 26 – 50  | ⚠️ **REVIEW** | Moderate risk — manual review required |
| 51 – 100 | ❌ **FAIL**   | High risk — blocked from publishing    |

**Any CRITICAL-severity finding automatically fails the gate**, regardless of the overall score.

---

## Verification Tags

When a scan on the `main` branch successfully passes (triggered by push, schedule, or manual dispatch), the CI pipeline automatically creates a dated Git tag:

```
skillspector-verified-v20260622
```

This tag is created only by the automated pipeline — never manually. The tag is annotated but not GPG-signed. You can verify authenticity by checking that the tagger is `github-actions[bot]` and verifying the associated [GitHub Actions run](https://github.com/HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard/actions/workflows/skillspector-scan.yml).

---

## Running the Scanner Locally

Before submitting a PR that modifies skills, run SkillSpector locally to catch issues early:

### Option A — Docker (recommended, no Python install needed)

```bash
# Clone SkillSpector
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/skillspector /tmp/skillspector
docker build -t skillspector /tmp/skillspector

# Scan your skill directory
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/scan" skillspector scan ./skills/ --no-llm

# Or scan a single skill
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/scan" skillspector scan ./skills/react/react-hooks/ --no-llm

# Generate a Markdown report
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/scan" skillspector scan ./skills/ --no-llm --format markdown --output report.md
```

### Option B — Python (uv or pip)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/skillspector
cd skillspector
uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
make install

# Scan
skillspector scan /path/to/agent-skills-standard/skills/ --no-llm
```

### Interpreting results

```
Risk Score: 0/100  ← 0 is perfect
Severity: INFO
Findings: 0
```

A score of **0** with no findings means your skill is clean. If you see findings:

1. Read the pattern description — most findings in skill files are `INFO` or `LOW` (false positives from keywords)
2. MEDIUM/HIGH findings in a skill file should be investigated — ensure the instructions don't accidentally look like injection patterns
3. Never include executable code, secret patterns, or external URLs with credentials in a `SKILL.md`

---

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue **in the skills themselves** (e.g., a skill that could instruct an agent to perform malicious actions):

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Report it via [GitHub Private Security Advisories](https://github.com/HoangNguyen0403/agent-skills-standard/security/advisories/new).
3. Include: the skill path, the problematic instruction, and the potential impact.

We aim to respond within **48 hours** and remediate within **7 days** for HIGH/CRITICAL issues.

## CI Pipeline Integration

The security scan is wired into the pipeline as follows:

```
PR touches skills/**
    → skillspector-scan.yml triggered
    → SkillSpector Docker image built (cached)
    → Filtered directory created (SKILL.md files only)
    → Security documentation skills excluded
    → SKILL.md files scanned (64 patterns, --no-llm)
    → references/ and evals/ directories excluded (contain educational examples)
    → SARIF uploaded → GitHub Security tab
    → Score evaluated: pass/fail gate
    → PR comment posted with results

Push to main (scan passes)
    → skillspector-verified-vYYYYMMDD tag created
    → GitHub Release created
```

### Scan Scope

- ✅ **Scanned**: SKILL.md and \_INDEX.md files (actual skill instructions)
- ❌ **Excluded**: references/, evals/ directories (supporting docs with educational code examples)

### Excluded Skills

The following skills are **excluded from automated scanning** because they contain educational security content, penetration testing examples, or AI security guidance that intentionally includes exploit patterns, threat-modeling language, and prompt-injection examples. These skills are skipped from SkillSpector verification to avoid false positives while preserving their educational and guidance value.

- `common-pentest-methodology` — Penetration testing methodology and exploit examples
- `common-dast-tooling` — Dynamic application security testing tools and usage
- `common-exploit-verification` — Exploit verification techniques
- `common-owasp` — OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities with examples
- `common-llm-security` — LLM security patterns and AI-security guidance
- `common-security-audit` — Security audit methodology (contains vulnerability patterns)
- `common-security-standards` — Security standards documentation (contains vulnerability remediation examples)

These skills are **safe** — they teach security testing practices, AI security guidance, and vulnerability examples for educational purposes. They are excluded to prevent false positives in the automated scan and are therefore skipped from the SkillSpector verification gate.

See the [workflow file](../.github/workflows/skillspector-scan.yml) for full implementation details.
