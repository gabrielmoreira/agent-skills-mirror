# Requirements Standards Baseline

This baseline defines where BRD, PRD, and SRS/FRS workflow guidance is derived from. It ships
with `common-software-requirements` so consumers always have it; `common-business-requirements`,
`common-product-requirements` and the `sdlc` workflow link here.

## Why You Can Trust This Baseline

- It is derived from public, widely-used requirements/specification references (product, engineering, standards bodies).
- SDLC workflows and skills link to this file so users can audit where the guidance came from.
- Teams can override local conventions, but changes should update this baseline so the repo stays self-explaining.

## BRD (Business "Why")

- Business requirements structure and stakeholder/value framing:
  - https://techwhirl.com/business-requirements-document-brd-template/
  - https://www.pandadoc.com/business-requirements-document-template/
  - https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/tips-for-a-perfect-business-requirements-document
  - https://www.inventive.ai/blog-posts/business-requirements-document
- What this repo adopts:
  - BRD captures stakeholder input, SMART objectives, AS-IS/TO-BE context, scope, cost-benefit/value hypothesis, glossary, and validation owners.
  - BRD stays solution-free; functional behavior routes to PRD or SRS/FRS.
  - Complex current/future processes should include a lightweight Mermaid diagram.

## PRD (Product "What")

- Product requirements and living-spec practice:
  - https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements
  - https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/templates/product-requirements
  - https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/writing-requirements/product-requirements-document/
  - https://pharos-solutions.de/blog/product-requirements-document-guide/
  - https://www.uladshauchenka.com/p/how-to-write-a-good-product-requirements
- What this repo adopts:
  - PRD is an alignment artifact for goals, users, scope, use cases, acceptance criteria, NFR cues, analytics, risks, rollout, decisions, and changelog.
  - Acceptance criteria should be verifiable, preferably Given/When/Then when behavior can be misread by engineering or QA.
  - User stories must use specific actors, clear business value, and INVEST-style quality checks before handoff.

## SRS/FRS (Technical "How")

- Requirements engineering and specification discipline:

  - https://aravindakumar.medium.com/automating-srs-creation-with-agentic-workflows-unlocking-seamless-consistency-and-productivity-f2aff2efc861
- What this repo adopts:
  - SRS preserves problem-to-need-to-requirement traceability: `BRD-OBJ-* -> REQ-* -> AC-* -> SRS-* -> test evidence`.
  - Requirements are written as measurable cards with priority, status, source, behavior, failure modes, NFRs, measurement method, and verification lane.
  - Complex flows use use-case discipline: one actor, one goal, one session; normal course separated from alternatives and exceptions.

- What this repo adopts:
  - AI-readable specs use explicit Markdown sections, commands, boundaries, validation gates, and living-document changelogs.
- **Slug Alignment Protocol**: To maintain traceability across dozens of features, all related requirement layers MUST use a consistent `[slug]` in the filename.
  - Business: `docs/brd/brd-[slug].md`
  - Product: `docs/prd/prd-[slug].md`
  - Technical: `docs/srs/srs-[slug].md`
  - Slug format: lowercase kebab-case (`[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*`), max 40 characters, minted once at `brainstorm-feature` from the feature name with stopwords dropped. Reused verbatim by every downstream workflow — never re-derived. On collision, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

## Operator Profile Contract

Every operator-facing workflow (`sdlc`, `brainstorm-feature`, `plan-feature`, `verify-work`, `uat-signoff`, `publish-notes`, `session-report`) infers `operator_profile` (`business | hybrid | technical`) from request phrasing per `common-operator-profile` — never by asking the operator to self-classify — and carries it in the Handoff Payload so downstream workflows never re-infer it. See the `common-operator-profile` skill for inference signals, per-tier register rules, and the proxy-defaults rule that lets `brainstorm-feature` draft sponsor/metric/scope defaults instead of blocking a non-technical operator outright.

## Portable Outcome Report Contract

Every SDLC workflow should make the human outcome clear even when a runtime cannot finish implementation or verification:

- `feature_status`: `not_started | requirements_ready | design_ready | partially_implemented | implemented | blocked`
- `requirement_trace`: `BRD-OBJ-* -> REQ-* -> AC-* -> SRS-* -> evidence`
- `completed_evidence`: artifacts, tests, reviews, or approvals already proven
- `missing_evidence`: proof gaps separated from implementation status
- `decision_needed`: owner/input required before the next step
- `recommended_next_workflow`: the next portable workflow to run

This contract is runtime-neutral. Adapters may map it to task boards, MCP tools, Jira, GitHub, GitLab, ADO, Zephyr, or local files, but canonical skills and workflows should not depend on adapter-specific IDs, chat channels, containers, or mount paths.
