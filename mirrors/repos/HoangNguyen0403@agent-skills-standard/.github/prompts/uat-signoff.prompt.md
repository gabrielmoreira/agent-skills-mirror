# UAT Signoff Workflow

Goal: Convert a `verify-work` PASS into an explicit, evidence-linked business acceptance decision before release.

## Steps

1. Load scope:
   - `verify-work` report, AC list, PRD/BRD-lite business objective, and inherited `operator_profile` (carry, do not re-infer).
   - Load `common-operator-profile`.
   - `release_confidence` from `test-loop` or `quality-engineering-automation-health` when available; present it in plain language.
2. Draft demo script:
   - Map each AC to an observable business outcome in plain language; omit file paths, commands, and code identifiers from the primary script.
   - For `operator_profile=business` or `hybrid`, this plain-language script is the primary artifact; keep technical trace in a trailing appendix.
3. Walk the signoff:
   - Present each AC outcome and ask the approver to accept or reject.
   - Ask max 3 blocking questions at a time with a recommended default and 2-3 options.
   - Record conditions attached to any conditional acceptance.
4. Capture decision:
   - Signoff owner, date, and per-AC accept/reject status.
   - Reject on any AC -> route to `dev-fix`.
   - Full accept -> route to `deploy-release`.
5. Persist:
   - Write the run record to `artifacts/runs/[slug]/[compactISO]-uat-signoff.json` when file writes are allowed.

## Runtime Contract
- Use after `verify-work` PASS on a feature, before `deploy-release`.
- Required inputs: a PASS verification report with an AC list to demo against.
- Return BLOCKED only when no verification report exists or the approver is unavailable in autonomous/channel mode.
## Handoff Payload
- `slug`, `operator_profile`, `release_confidence`, signoff owner, per-AC decision, conditions, outcome report, next workflow.
## Blocking Questions
- Ask max 3 at a time with a recommended default and 2-3 options.
