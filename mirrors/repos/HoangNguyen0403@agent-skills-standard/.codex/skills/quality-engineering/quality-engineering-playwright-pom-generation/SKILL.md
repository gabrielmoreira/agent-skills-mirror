description: Generates Playwright page objects from an executable test plan, one class per screen with ladder-compliant locators and no assertions, wired into a shared fixture. Use when a web scenario needs a page object that does not exist yet, or when locators drift and the page object must be rebuilt.

# Quality Engineering: Playwright Page Object Generation

## **Priority: P1 (HIGH)**

## Input

A web-lane scenario block from `docs/srs/test-plan-[slug].md` (`Steps`, `Expected`, `@AC-n`) plus the resolved `SELECTOR_GAPS` for that screen. Generate from the plan, never from a live DOM crawl alone: the plan says which elements matter.

## Layout

- One file per screen: `tests/pages/<screen>.page.ts`, class `<Screen>Page` (e.g. `CheckoutPage`).
- One locator getter per element the plan touches, named after the element (`submitButton`, `emailInput`).
- One action method per plan step verb (`fillShipping(data)`, `submit()`); actions return `void` or the next page object.
- A `pages` fixture in `tests/fixtures.ts` exposes every page object; specs import `test` from there, never from `@playwright/test` directly.

## Locator Rules

Follow the web ladder in `quality-engineering-selector-stability`: `getByRole` / `getByLabel` first, then `getByTestId` using the `<screen>-<element>-<role>` id, then attribute CSS. Never XPath, `nth`, text on translated strings, or generated class names. When the element has no stable locator, do not invent one: record it as a selector gap for `specialist-testid-inserter`.

## No Assertions in Page Objects

Page objects expose state (`orderId()`, `isVisible()`), specs assert on it. An `expect` inside a page object hides the assertion from the scenario and breaks reuse across positive and negative cases.

## Workflow

1. Read the scenario block and the screen's existing page object, if any; extend rather than duplicate.
2. Map each plan step to an existing or new action method; map each `Expected` to a state getter.
3. Write locators per the ladder; list unresolved elements under `Selector Gaps` in the output.
4. Register the page object in the `pages` fixture.
5. Run `npx tsc --noEmit -p tests` (or the repo's typecheck) and the seed spec once.

## Anti-Patterns

- **No assertions in page objects**: `expect` belongs in the spec.
- **No DOM-crawl page objects**: a class with forty getters nobody's scenario uses is noise, not coverage.
- **No duplicate page object**: search `tests/pages/` before creating; extend the existing class.
- **No raw `page` in specs**: every interaction goes through a page object or the seed.
- **No renamed test ids**: ids are a public contract; a rename is a selector gap, not a refactor.
