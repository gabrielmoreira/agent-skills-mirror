# Feature Planning Workflow (PRD / What)

Goal: Produce a decision-complete PRD and implementation plan before code starts.

## Steps

1. Load context:
   - Load baseline: `docs/requirements-standards-baseline.md` (PRD section).
   - BRD-lite brief, ticket, or user request.
   - Jira/GitHub/GitLab/ADO MCP ticket data when configured; otherwise local ticket text.
   - Existing specs, design references, and repo patterns.
   - `common-product-requirements`, `quality-engineering-business-analysis`, and matched framework skills.
2. Interview:
   - Ask only for business logic, scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria that cannot be inferred.
   - Confirm problem statement, assumptions, target users, JTBD/use cases, platforms, data, analytics, security, performance, rollout, and non-goals.
   - Confirm each requirement has owner, priority, and status.
   - Confirm success metrics and guardrails that must not regress.
   - Stop when requirements are actionable.
3. Draft PRD:
   - Save to `docs/specs/prd-[slug].md` when file writes are allowed.
   - Keep "what" separate from "how".
   - Add stable requirement IDs and AC IDs.
   - Use Given/When/Then AC when behavior can be misread.
   - Check user stories for specific persona, business value, INVEST, happy path, edge path, and negative path.
   - Link each requirement back to BRD-lite business objective.
   - Include risk categories, rollout/ops, decision log, analytics/telemetry, and changelog.
   - Mark unresolved items as blockers, not assumptions.
4. Create implementation plan:
   - Define components, contracts, data changes, migrations, risks, and verification.
   - Slice work into fresh-context tasks.
   - Identify whether `design-solution` is required before coding.
5. Route:
   - Architecture unclear -> `design-solution`.
   - Plan approved and build-ready -> `implement-feature`.
