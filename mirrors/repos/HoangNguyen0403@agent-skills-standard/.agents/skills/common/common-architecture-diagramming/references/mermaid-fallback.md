# Export Paths and the Mermaid Fallback

## Getting an image out of the `.drawio`

The spec, validator, renderer, and layout check are plain Python and always run, so the
`.drawio` file and its machine check never depend on tooling. Only the image does. Take the
first path that exists, in this order:

1. **A draw.io MCP tool** in the session (any tool that opens, exports, or edits a
   diagrams.net document). Use it to export PNG or SVG from the rendered file and to open it
   for hand refinement. The `.drawio` on disk stays the source of truth; do not let the MCP
   author shapes from scratch, that bypasses the house style, the legend, and the evidence
   properties.
2. **draw.io Desktop** via `scripts/export_drawio.py` (`DRAWIO_BIN`, then `PATH`, then the
   per-OS install locations). Missing binary: the script exits 1 with an install hint.
3. **Neither available**: deliver the `.drawio` and say so. The specialist's `DIAGRAM:` line
   reads `image: not exported (no draw.io MCP or CLI)`. Never hand-draw SVG or ASCII as a
   substitute; the layout check already proved the picture, the reader opens the file.

## When Mermaid is right

draw.io is the deliverable. Mermaid is correct in exactly three cases:

1. **The diagram has to live inside a file that renders it** — a README, an ADR, a pull
   request description, a Confluence page. Nobody expands a `.drawio` attachment mid-review.
2. **draw.io Desktop is unavailable** and the reader needs a picture now. Write the spec
   anyway, ship the Mermaid, and render the `.drawio` when the CLI is back.
3. **A live interview practice round in chat**, where the candidate is on a whiteboard clock
   and nobody opens a `.drawio` mid-round. Rules in
   `system-design-interview-coaching/references/whiteboard-rules.md`; the model answer after
   the round may go through the pipeline.

Everything else — anything an executive will read, anything that needs official cloud icons,
a legend, a title block, or hand-refinement afterwards — goes through the spec pipeline.

## Rules when you do use it

Same standard, fewer shapes: label every arrow, one level per diagram, expand acronyms,
state the scope and date in the surrounding prose, and mark unproven nodes explicitly since
Mermaid has no UNVERIFIED style.

```mermaid
graph LR
    User["Customer"] -->|Places order / HTTPS| Web["Web App<br/>Next.js"]
    Web -->|GraphQL| API["Order Engine<br/>Go"]
    API -->|SQL| DB[("Cloud SQL")]
    API -.->|Publishes order.created| Queue["Pub/Sub"]
```

Dashed means asynchronous here too. Keep the conventions identical across both lanes, or
readers have to learn two visual languages.

## Importing into draw.io

Recent draw.io Desktop can import Mermaid via Arrange > Insert > Advanced > Mermaid, which
converts it to native editable shapes. It is not a shortcut to house style: the result has
no legend, no title block, and no evidence properties, and re-editing the Mermaid source
discards any layout you fixed by hand. Use the renderer instead.
