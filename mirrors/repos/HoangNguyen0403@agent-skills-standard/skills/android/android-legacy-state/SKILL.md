# Android Legacy State Standards

## **Priority: P1 (HIGH)**

## Implementation Guidelines

### Flow Consumption

- **Rule**: ALWAYS use `repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.STARTED)` to collect flows in Views.
- **Why**: Prevents crashes (collecting while view destroyed) and saves resources (stops collecting in background).

### LiveData vs Flow

- **New Code**: Use `StateFlow` exclusively.
- **Legacy**: If using LiveData, observe with `viewLifecycleOwner` (Fragment), NOT `this`.

## Anti-Patterns

- **No launchWhenStarted/Resumed**: Deprecated. Use repeatOnLifecycle instead.
- **No observe(this) in Fragments**: Use viewLifecycleOwner to prevent lifecycle leaks.
