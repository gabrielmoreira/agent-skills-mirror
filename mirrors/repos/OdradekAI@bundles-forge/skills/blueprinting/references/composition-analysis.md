# Composition Analysis

When the user wants to combine multiple existing skills into a unified bundle-plugin, analyze compatibility and design the orchestration before scaffolding.

## C1. Inventory Existing Skills

Collect all candidate skills. For each one, record:
- Source (local file, git repo, marketplace plugin, another bundle-plugin project)
- Current structure (standalone SKILL.md, has references/, has scripts/)
- Frontmatter quality (has name/description? follows conventions?)
- Rigid or flexible type

**For third-party skills** (marketplace, GitHub, other bundle-plugins), additionally record:
- License (MIT, Apache-2.0, proprietary, unknown)
- Version or commit hash at time of evaluation
- Maintenance status (actively maintained, archived, unknown)
- Original project name and namespace (for cross-reference rewriting)

## C2. Analyze Compatibility

Check for issues that need resolution before combining:

| Check | What to Look For |
|-------|-----------------|
| Naming conflicts | Two skills with the same or confusingly similar names |
| Description style | Inconsistent patterns (some start with "Use when...", some don't) |
| Overlapping responsibilities | Skills that do similar things — merge, deduplicate, or clearly scope each |
| Shared dependencies | Multiple skills referencing the same tools, scripts, or external resources |
| Cross-reference conventions | Mismatched project prefixes or reference styles |

**For third-party skills**, also check:

| Check | What to Look For |
|-------|-----------------|
| License compatibility | Can this license coexist with the project's license? |
| Security posture | Does the skill invoke external tools, network calls, or eval()? Run `bundles-forge:auditing` |
| Staleness risk | Is the skill actively maintained? Will you need to own updates? |

Classify each skill as:
- **Ready** — can be included as-is
- **Needs adaptation** — rename, rewrite description, adjust references
- **Needs merge** — overlaps with another skill, combine into one
- **Needs import** — third-party skill requiring copy + source attribution

## C3. Integration Intent & Security Audit (for third-party skills)

For each skill classified as **Needs import**, follow the third-party integration process via `bundles-forge:optimizing` (specifically its third-party integration reference). This covers:

- Integration intent classification (repackage as-is vs integrate into workflow)
- Source attribution template
- Mandatory security audit via `bundles-forge:auditing`
- Intent B adaptation steps (rewrite description, cross-references, workflow declarations)

## C4. Design the Orchestration

With the inventory and compatibility analysis in hand, design how the skills work together:

- **Workflow chains** — which skills call or depend on each other? Map the full dependency graph
- **Independent skills** — which skills stand alone with no dependencies?
- **Glue skills** — do you need new skills to bridge gaps between existing ones (e.g., a skill that coordinates the handoff between two unrelated skills)?
- **Shared resources** — extract common scripts, reference docs, or templates into project-level `scripts/` or shared `references/` files
- **Bootstrap routing** — design the `using-<project>` skill's routing table to cover all composed skills

Present the composition plan to the user. Get approval before proceeding to Phase 1: Needs Exploration to finalize project details like name, platforms, and bootstrap strategy.
