# Bundle-Plugin Anatomy

Complete reference for every file and directory in a well-engineered bundle-plugin project. Use this when scaffolding a new project or auditing an existing one.

## Root Files

### `package.json`

Project identity. Minimal — no dependencies (bundle-plugins are zero-dependency by design). The `main` field points to the OpenCode plugin entry if OpenCode is a target platform.

```json
{
  "name": "<project-name>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "main": ".opencode/plugins/<project-name>.js"
}
```

If OpenCode is not a target, omit the `main` field.

### `README.md`

The project's public face. Must contain:
- One-sentence description of what the project provides
- Installation instructions per target platform (separate subsection each)
- Skill catalog — list every skill with its trigger description
- Workflow diagram (if skills chain together)
- Contributing pointer (if open-source)

### `CHANGELOG.md`

Release history. Use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. Group by version, date, and change type (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed).

### `LICENSE`

Default to MIT. Match the user's preference.

### `CLAUDE.md`

Contributor guidelines for AI agents working on the project. Covers PR requirements, what changes are accepted/rejected, testing expectations. This is the authority document — `AGENTS.md` points to it.

### `AGENTS.md`

Codex convention. Contents: a single line pointing to `CLAUDE.md`. Codex reads `AGENTS.md` for agent instructions.

```
CLAUDE.md
```

### `GEMINI.md`

Gemini CLI context file. Uses `@` includes to pull in the bootstrap skill and tool mapping:

```
@./skills/using-<project>/SKILL.md
@./skills/using-<project>/references/gemini-tools.md
```

Gemini reads this file on session start (declared via `contextFileName` in `gemini-extension.json`).

### `.version-bump.json`

Declares every file containing the project version, plus audit exclusions. Structure: a `files` array (one entry per version-bearing manifest with `path` and `field`) and an `audit.exclude` list to prevent false positives when scanning for stale version strings.

Only include entries for platforms the project actually targets. See `assets/root/version-bump.json` for the canonical template.

### `.gitignore`

Essential entries:

```
node_modules/
.worktrees/
worktrees/
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
*.log
```

### `gemini-extension.json`

Gemini CLI extension metadata. Only generate if Gemini is a target platform.

```json
{
  "name": "<project-name>",
  "description": "<one-line project description>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "contextFileName": "GEMINI.md"
}
```

---

## `.claude-plugin/` — Claude Code

### `plugin.json`

Marketplace metadata for Claude Code. Does NOT declare skills/hooks paths — Claude Code discovers those by convention (skills at `skills/`, hooks at `hooks/hooks.json`).

```json
{
  "name": "<project-name>",
  "description": "<one-line description>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "<author>",
    "email": "<email>"
  },
  "homepage": "<repo-url>",
  "repository": "<repo-url>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["skills", "<relevant>", "<keywords>"]
}
```

### `marketplace.json` (optional)

Marketplace listing if publishing to Claude Code's plugin marketplace. Contains a `plugins` array with source paths.

---

## `.cursor-plugin/` — Cursor

### `plugin.json`

Cursor plugin manifest. Unlike Claude Code, Cursor requires explicit path declarations:

```json
{
  "name": "<project-name>",
  "displayName": "<Display Name>",
  "description": "<one-line description>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "<author>",
    "email": "<email>"
  },
  "homepage": "<repo-url>",
  "repository": "<repo-url>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["skills"],
  "skills": "./skills/",
  "agents": "./agents/",
  "hooks": "./hooks/hooks-cursor.json"
}
```

Key difference from Claude Code: `skills`, `agents`, and `hooks` paths are explicit.

---

## `.codex/` — Codex

### `INSTALL.md`

Manual setup instructions. Codex uses native skill discovery from `~/.agents/skills/`. The install process is: clone the repo, symlink `skills/` into the discovery directory.

Include both Unix and Windows (PowerShell) commands. The symlink/junction is what makes skills visible to Codex.

---

## `.opencode/` — OpenCode

### `INSTALL.md`

Instructions for adding the plugin to `opencode.json`.

### `plugins/<project-name>.js`

ESM module that:
1. Registers the project's `skills/` path in OpenCode's config (so skills are discovered without symlinks)
2. Injects bootstrap content into the first user message of each session
3. Provides tool mapping (OpenCode tool names differ from Claude Code)

The plugin uses OpenCode's hook API: `config` for path registration, `experimental.chat.messages.transform` for bootstrap injection.

---

## `hooks/` — Session Bootstrap

### `session-start` (Bash) + `run-hook.cmd` (polyglot)

`session-start` is an extensionless Bash script for cross-platform bootstrap injection. Dynamically discovers skills, builds a lightweight prompt, and emits platform-appropriate JSON. `run-hook.cmd` is a CMD+Bash polyglot wrapper that finds bash on Windows (Git for Windows) and runs the script. Shared between Claude Code and Cursor. For the full pipeline, platform detection table, and hook format comparison, see `references/platform-adapters.md` § "Shared Hook: session-start".

### `hooks.json`

Claude Code hook descriptor. The top-level `description` is shown in the `/hooks` menu; `timeout` prevents slow hooks from blocking session start.

```json
{
  "description": "Bootstrap: injects skill routing context on session start",
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup|clear|compact",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run-hook.cmd\" session-start",
            "timeout": 10,
            "async": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### `hooks-cursor.json`

Cursor hook descriptor (simpler format):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/session-start"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## `skills/` — Skill Content

### Structure

One directory per skill. The directory name must match the `name` field in the skill's YAML frontmatter.

```
skills/
  using-<project>/          # Bootstrap skill (always-loaded)
    SKILL.md
    references/
      codex-tools.md        # Codex tool mapping
      gemini-tools.md       # Gemini CLI tool mapping
  <skill-name>/
    SKILL.md                # Required: frontmatter + body
    <supporting-file>.md    # Optional: heavy reference
    scripts/                # Optional: executable tools
```

### SKILL.md Requirements

Every SKILL.md must have YAML frontmatter with:
- `name` — kebab-case, letters/numbers/hyphens only, matches directory name
- `description` — starts with "Use when...", triggering conditions only, under 500 chars

The body follows the structure from `superpowers:writing-skills`: Overview, When to Use, Core Pattern, Quick Reference, Common Mistakes.

### Supporting Files

Only create supporting files when content exceeds what fits inline:
- **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) — API docs, syntax guides
- **Reusable scripts** — deterministic tools the skill invokes
- **Templates** — file templates the skill generates

---

## `agents/` — Shared Agent Prompts (optional)

Markdown files used as prompts when dispatching subagents. Referenced by skills via `agents/<role>.md`. Example: `agents/code-reviewer.md` contains the review template.

## Version Tooling

Version synchronization is provided by the `bundles-forge` CLI — target projects do not need to bundle their own scripts:
- `bundles-forge bump-version <version>` — update all declared files
- `bundles-forge bump-version --check` — detect drift between files
- `bundles-forge bump-version --audit` — check + scan repo for undeclared version strings

Projects that need standalone version bumping (e.g. for CI without bundles-forge installed) can optionally place a `scripts/bump_version.py` in the project root. The scaffolding template is available via `assets/scripts/bump_version.py`.

> **Note:** Paths like `skills/releasing/scripts/` and `skills/auditing/scripts/` are internal to the bundles-forge toolkit and do not exist in target projects.

## `tests/` — Integration Tests

Per-platform test scripts that verify skills are discoverable and loadable. Organized by platform:

```
tests/
  claude-code/
    run-skill-tests.sh
  opencode/
    setup.sh
    integration.sh
```

Tests typically use headless invocations (e.g., `claude -p` for Claude Code) to verify skill triggering and content loading.

## `docs/` — Documentation

Platform-specific READMEs, design documents, specs, and plans. Organized as needed — no strict structure required.

```
docs/
  README.codex.md
  README.opencode.md
  specs/
    2025-01-15-feature-design.md
```

---

## Optional / Advanced Components

These components are defined in the [Claude Code plugins reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference) but only needed for specific use cases. Only generate them when the design document explicitly requests them.

### `bin/` — Plugin Executables

Executables placed here are added to the Bash tool's `PATH` while the plugin is enabled. Files are invokable as bare commands in any Bash tool call.

Only create if skills need CLI tools that should be available as bare commands. Ensure executables are marked `chmod +x`.

### `output-styles/` — Output Style Definitions

Custom output formatting definitions as Markdown files. Only create if the project needs specialized output beyond the platform defaults.

### `settings.json` — Plugin Default Settings

Default configuration applied when the plugin is enabled. Currently only supports the `agent` key to activate one of the plugin's custom agents as the main thread:

```json
{
  "agent": "security-reviewer"
}
```

Only create if the project should change how the host platform behaves by default when the plugin is enabled.

### `.mcp.json` — MCP Server Definitions

Bundle Model Context Protocol servers with the plugin. Servers start automatically when the plugin is enabled. Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for paths to bundled scripts:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plugin-database": {
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/db-server",
      "args": ["--config", "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

Only create if skills need external tool integrations beyond what the host platform provides natively.

### `.lsp.json` — LSP Server Configurations

Language Server Protocol configurations for code intelligence (diagnostics, go-to-definition, find references). Maps file extensions to language server commands:

```json
{
  "go": {
    "command": "gopls",
    "args": ["serve"],
    "extensionToLanguage": {
      ".go": "go"
    }
  }
}
```

Only create if skills involve language-specific code intelligence. The language server binary must be installed separately by the user.

### `userConfig` — User-Configurable Values (in plugin.json)

Declared in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` under the `userConfig` field. Claude Code prompts the user for these values when the plugin is enabled. Available as `${user_config.KEY}` in MCP/LSP configs and hook commands:

```json
{
  "userConfig": {
    "api_endpoint": {
      "description": "Your team's API endpoint",
      "sensitive": false
    },
    "api_token": {
      "description": "API authentication token",
      "sensitive": true
    }
  }
}
```

Sensitive values are stored in the system keychain; non-sensitive values go to `settings.json`.

---

## Environment Variables

Two plugin-scoped variables are provided by the host platform. Both are substituted inline in skill content, agent content, hook commands, and MCP/LSP configs. Both are also exported to hook processes and server subprocesses.

- **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`** — absolute path to the plugin's installation directory. Use for referencing bundled scripts, binaries, and config files. This path changes on plugin updates, so do not write persistent data here.

- **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`** — persistent directory for plugin state that survives updates. Use for installed dependencies (`node_modules`, virtual environments), caches, and generated files. Created automatically on first reference. Deleted when the plugin is uninstalled from its last scope.

---

## Plugin Caching Behavior

Marketplace plugins are copied to `~/.claude/plugins/cache` rather than used in-place. This has important implications:

- **Path traversal limitation**: Paths that reference files outside the plugin root (e.g., `../shared-utils`) will not work after installation because external files are not copied to the cache.
- **Symlinks are followed**: If your plugin needs external files, create symlinks within the plugin directory. Symlinked content is copied during cache population.
- **Version isolation**: Each installed version is a separate cache directory. Old versions are cleaned up 7 days after update.

For persistent data that should survive plugin updates, use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` instead of writing to the plugin root.
