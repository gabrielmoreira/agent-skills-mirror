**Safe Update Protocol** — Always follow these steps exactly before updating any package:

1. **Parse the request**  
   Extract: package manager (npm/pip/etc.), package name(s), and target version (or "latest").

2. **Gather metadata**  
   Run the appropriate registry command:
   - npm: `npm info <package> --json`
   - pip: `pip show <package>` or `python -m pip index versions <package>`
   Extract: latest version publish date, maintainers, weekly downloads, repository URL.

3. **Security & Freshness Check**  
   - Flag any version published in the last 30 days as "high risk — recent release".
   - Use `web_search` for: "<package> supply chain attack OR malicious OR compromised OR yanked" (focus on last 60 days).
   - Check for known vulnerabilities: `npm audit` (for npm) or equivalent.

4. **Risk Summary**  
   Provide a clear summary:
   - Age of the new version
   - Any red flags from search
   - Maintainer reputation signals
   - Recommendation (Safe / Caution / High Risk)

5. **Human Approval**  
   Always ask the user explicitly:  
   "Findings: [summary]. Do you want to proceed with the update? (yes/no)"

6. **Execute only on approval**  
   If user says yes, run the actual update command (e.g. `npm update <package>` or `npm install <package>@latest`).
   Then run `npm audit` (or equivalent) and report results.

7. **Log the decision**  
   Use `write` to append a short entry to `SCRATCHPAD.md` or a dedicated update log with date, package, version, and risk level.

**Extra Caution Rules:**
- Be extra careful with AI-related packages (litellm, openai, langchain, transformers, etc.).
- Never run post-install scripts automatically if possible (`--ignore-scripts`).
- Prefer updating one package at a time unless the user explicitly asks for all.

Start by asking the user which package(s) they want to update safely.
