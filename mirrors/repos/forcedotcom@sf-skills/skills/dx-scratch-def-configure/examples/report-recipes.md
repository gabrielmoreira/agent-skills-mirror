# Scratch Def Report

Plain prose — never the backtick character. Spell skill names as plain words.

STOP recipes go on disk (Write / write_file). Chat is not a substitute. Name
the next skill. Never Skill() another skill. Never run `sf`.

If they change the draft (including a write request that also edits it), use
Happy-path draft. This turn's wording is the full draft. Do not require a
prior file or earlier chat. Do not apply. If they consent that this preview
is the draft they want written, unchanged — accepting this draft as drafted,
not a first generate that says write or skip preview — use Happy-path write.

---

## Shape-only stop

- Shape-only request with no features to layer. Not writing a scratch-def.
- Next: dx-org-shape-manage for org shape lifecycle. Pass along any
  source org alias, username, or shape id the user named.

## Snapshot-only stop

- Next: dx-org-snapshot-manage.
- Pass along Dev Hub, snapshot name/id, and create/list/get intent.

## Trial stop

- Next: platform-trial-org-create. Scratch-defs are not trial templates.

## Underspecified stop

- Need two details before drafting a scratch-def.
- 1. What are you building or demoing?
- 2. Which products or clouds should the org include?
- Stopping here without inventing an edition or feature set.

If `config/` is also missing, add the Missing-project question to this same
report. Do not invent a path.

## Other-user / no path stop

- Cannot read another user's machine or invent a seed file.
- Provide a readable workspace path or paste the file contents to continue.

## Shape or snapshot plus features, missing id

- Ask for a sourceOrg or snapshot id/name. Name dx-org-shape-manage /
  dx-org-snapshot-manage to list. Resume this skill with the id.

## Missing project config stop

- Current directory has no config folder, so this is not the Salesforce DX
  project where scratch orgs will be created.
- Not creating a config folder.
- What is the path to your Salesforce DX project (the directory that already
  contains a config folder)?

## Batch generation stop

- Batch generation of multiple scratch-def files in one turn is not supported yet.
- Want me to make the first one?

## Happy-path draft (preview)

Keep the draft in chat/tool context and pass it to preview on stdin with <<'EOF'.

In chat, show the schema-valid preview document (helper result document) as a
fenced JSON block alongside this report.

- Paraphrase the intent.
- Edition (or sourceOrg / snapshot when layering).
- Features kept; settings enriched.
- Output path after confirm: config/project-scratch-def.json (or another
  config/purpose-scratch-def.json).
Write file?

Do not name dx-org-manage. JSON and the card go in chat.
Do not mention dropped tokens, prior cache date, shipped snapshot JSON, or
jsonschema in this report unless the helper actually warned this turn. When
jsonschema is missing, also ask in chat to install it; continue if install
fails.

## Happy-path write (after consent to this preview)

In chat, show the final written scratch-def JSON as a fenced block alongside
this report.

- Applied the in-context draft (stdin quoted heredoc) to
  config/project-scratch-def.json (or the purpose-named path used).
- One-line summary of edition and features.
- Next: dx-org-manage with that path; dx-org-devhub-configure if Dev Hub is off.
Do not ask Write file?.

Same helper-warnings rule as preview: include them only when the helper
warned this turn.
