# Bria — AI Image Generation, Editing & Background Removal

Commercially safe, royalty-free image generation and editing through 20+ API endpoints. Generate from text, edit with natural language, remove backgrounds, create product shots, and build automated image pipelines.

For additional endpoint details beyond what is documented here, see the [Bria API reference for agents](https://docs.bria.ai/llms.txt).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- **Generate images** — "create an image of...", "make me a banner", "generate a hero image", "I need a product photo"
- **Edit images** — "change the background", "make it look like winter", "add a vase to the table", "remove the person"
- **Remove/replace backgrounds** — "make the background transparent", "cut out the product", "replace with a studio background"
- **Product photography** — "create a lifestyle shot", "place this product in a kitchen scene", "e-commerce packshot"
- **Enhance/transform** — "upscale this image", "make it higher resolution", "restyle as oil painting", "change the lighting"
- **Batch/pipeline** — "generate 10 product images", "process all these images", "remove backgrounds in bulk"

This skill handles the full spectrum of AI image operations. If the user mentions images, photos, visuals, or any visual content creation — use this skill.

## What You Can Build

- **E-commerce product catalog** — Generate product photos, remove backgrounds for transparent PNGs, place products in lifestyle scenes (kitchen, office, outdoor), create packshots with consistent style
- **Landing page visuals** — Generate hero images, abstract tech backgrounds, team photos, and section illustrations — all matching your brand aesthetic
- **Social media content** — Instagram posts (1:1), Stories/Reels (9:16), LinkedIn banners (16:9), ad creatives — batch-generate variants for A/B testing
- **Marketing campaign assets** — Seasonal transformations (summer→winter), restyle product shots for different markets, create localized visuals at scale
- **Photo restoration pipeline** — Restore old damaged photos, colorize black & white images, upscale low-res photos to 4x, enhance quality automatically
- **Brand asset toolkit** — Remove backgrounds from logos, blend artwork onto products (t-shirts, mugs), create consistent product photography across your entire catalog
- **AI-powered design workflows** — Chain operations: generate→edit→remove background→place in scene→upscale — all automated through API pipelines

## Setup — Authentication

Before making any API call, you need a valid Bria access token.

### Step 1: Check for existing credentials

```bash
if [ -f ~/.bria/credentials ]; then
  BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(grep '^access_token=' "$HOME/.bria/credentials" | cut -d= -f2-)
  BRIA_API_KEY=$(grep '^api_token=' "$HOME/.bria/credentials" | cut -d= -f2-)
fi
if [ -z "$BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "NO_CREDENTIALS"
elif [ -n "$BRIA_API_KEY" ]; then
  echo "READY"
else
  echo "CREDENTIALS_FOUND"
fi
```

If the output is `READY`, skip straight to making API calls — no introspection needed.
If the output is `CREDENTIALS_FOUND`, skip to Step 3.
If the output is `NO_CREDENTIALS`, proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Authenticate via device authorization

Start the device authorization flow:

**2a. Request a device code:**

```bash
DEVICE_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/auth/device/authorize" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json")
echo "$DEVICE_RESPONSE"
```

Parse the response fields:
- `device_code` — used to poll for the token (keep this, don't show to user)
- `user_code` — the code the user must enter (e.g. `BRIA-XXXX`)
- `interval` — seconds between poll attempts

**2b. Show the user a single sign-in link.** Tell them exactly this — nothing more:

> **Connect your Bria account:** [Click here to sign in](https://platform.bria.ai/device/verify?user_code={user_code})
> Your code is **{user_code}** — it's already filled in.

Do NOT show two links. Do NOT show the raw URL separately. Do NOT use `verification_uri` from the API response. Keep it to one clickable link.

**2c. Poll for the token.** After showing the user the code, immediately start polling. Try up to 60 times with the given interval (default 5 seconds):

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 60); do
  TOKEN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/auth/token" \
    -d "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code" \
    -d "device_code=$DEVICE_CODE")
  ACCESS_TOKEN=$(printf '%s' "$TOKEN_RESPONSE" | sed -n 's/.*"access_token" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
  if [ -n "$ACCESS_TOKEN" ]; then
    BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN="$ACCESS_TOKEN"
    REFRESH_TOKEN=$(printf '%s' "$TOKEN_RESPONSE" | sed -n 's/.*"refresh_token" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
    mkdir -p ~/.bria
    printf 'access_token=%s\nrefresh_token=%s\n' "$BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$REFRESH_TOKEN" > "$HOME/.bria/credentials"
    echo "AUTHENTICATED"
    break
  fi
  sleep 5
done
```

If the output contains `AUTHENTICATED`, proceed to Step 3. Otherwise the code expired — start over from Step 2a.

**Do not proceed with any API call until authentication is confirmed.**

### Step 3: Verify billing status and resolve API key

Introspect the bearer token to check billing status and obtain the real API key for Bria API calls:

```bash
INTROSPECT=$(curl -s -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/auth/token/introspect" \
  -d "token=$BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN")
BILLING_STATUS=$(printf '%s' "$INTROSPECT" | sed -n 's/.*"billing_status" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
if [ "$BILLING_STATUS" = "blocked" ]; then
  BILLING_MSG=$(printf '%s' "$INTROSPECT" | sed -n 's/.*"billing_message" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
  echo "BILLING_ERROR: $BILLING_MSG"
fi
ACTIVE=$(printf '%s' "$INTROSPECT" | sed -n 's/.*"active" *: *\([^,}]*\).*/\1/p' | tr -d ' ')
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "false" ]; then
  # Clear stale tokens so re-auth starts fresh (credentials file is re-created in Step 2c)
  printf '' > "$HOME/.bria/credentials"
  echo "TOKEN_EXPIRED"
fi
BRIA_API_KEY=$(printf '%s' "$INTROSPECT" | sed -n 's/.*"api_token" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
if [ -n "$BRIA_API_KEY" ]; then
  grep -v '^api_token=' "$HOME/.bria/credentials" > "$HOME/.bria/credentials.tmp" 2>/dev/null || true
  printf 'api_token=%s\n' "$BRIA_API_KEY" >> "$HOME/.bria/credentials.tmp"
  mv "$HOME/.bria/credentials.tmp" "$HOME/.bria/credentials"
fi
```

Interpret the output:
- If it prints `BILLING_ERROR: ...` — relay the message to the user exactly as shown and **stop**. Do not make any API calls.
- If it prints `TOKEN_EXPIRED` — the session is no longer valid. Tell the user their session expired and restart from Step 2.
- Otherwise, `BRIA_API_KEY` now contains the real API key and is cached for future calls. Proceed to the next section.

## How to Call Any Endpoint

Use `bria_call` for all API calls. It handles URL passthrough, local file base64 encoding, JSON construction, API call, and async polling in a single function call. The API key is auto-loaded from `~/.bria/credentials`.

**First**, source the helper script at `references/code-examples/bria_client.sh` (resolve relative to this skill's directory).

```bash
source <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/bria_client.sh

# Generate (no image input — pass empty string)
RESULT=$(bria_call /v2/image/generate "" '"prompt": "your description", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "sync": true')

# Remove background
RESULT=$(bria_call /v2/image/edit/remove_background "/path/to/local/image.png")

# Replace background
RESULT=$(bria_call /v2/image/edit/replace_background "https://example.com/img.jpg" '"prompt": "sunset beach"')

# Edit image (uses images array — pass --key images)
RESULT=$(bria_call /v2/image/edit "/path/to/image.png" --key images '"instruction": "make it look warmer"')

# Edit with reference images — each --image adds the next one, in order
RESULT=$(bria_call /v2/image/edit "https://example.com/man.jpg" --key images \
  --image "https://example.com/santa.png" \
  '"instruction": "dress the man in image 1 in the santa outfit from image 2"')

# Upscale (`desired_increase` is 2 or 4 — no other value. Transparency is preserved by default)
RESULT=$(bria_call /v2/image/edit/increase_resolution "https://example.com/img.jpg" '"desired_increase": 4')

# Product cutout → transparent PNG (use --key file for a local image)
CUTOUT=$(bria_call /v1/product/cutout "/path/to/raw.jpg" --key file)

# Packshot on white from the cutout URL
RESULT=$(bria_call /v1/product/packshot "$CUTOUT" --key image_url '"background_color": "#FFFFFF"')

# Lifestyle shot
RESULT=$(bria_call /v1/product/lifestyle_shot_by_text "/path/to/product.png" '"scene_description": "modern kitchen countertop"')

# Product dimensions — auto-removes background, draws measurement callouts.
# Dual cm / in labels: repeat each dimension with the same name+position in both
# units and set "units_display": "dual_slash" so they merge into one "12 cm / 4.7 in" label.
RESULT=$(bria_call /v2/image/edit/product_dimensions "/path/to/product.png" \
  '"style": "default", "units_display": "dual_slash", "dimensions": [{"name": "height", "value": 12, "unit": "cm", "position": "left"}, {"name": "height", "value": 4.7, "unit": "in", "position": "left"}, {"name": "width_bottom", "value": 6, "unit": "cm", "position": "bottom"}, {"name": "width_bottom", "value": 2.4, "unit": "in", "position": "bottom"}], "title": "Gummies Bottle", "capacity": {"value": 500, "unit": "ml"}, "weight": {"value": 250, "unit": "g", "label": "Net Weight"}')

echo "$RESULT"
```

**Calling convention:** `bria_call <endpoint> <image_or_empty> [--key <json_key>] [extra JSON fields...]`
- Pass a URL, local file path, or `""` (empty) for endpoints without image input
- Use `--key images` when the endpoint expects an `images` array instead of `image`
- Add `--image <url_or_path>` once per extra reference image (`--key images`, up to 4 in total).
  Order is preserved: the positional image is "image 1", the first `--image` is "image 2", …
- Extra JSON fields are appended as key-value pairs: `'"key": "value"'`
- Returns the result image URL on success, or prints an error to stderr

**Editing with several images (2–4):** reach for a second image when the look the user wants
already exists as a picture — a specific outfit, product, logo, or scene — instead of something you
can describe in words. Put the image being edited first, references after it, and address them by
position in the instruction: *"dress the man in image 1 in the santa outfit from image 2"*. Say what
each reference contributes ("the background of image 3"), in plain prose. A single-image edit needs
no positional wording: *"change the mug color to red"*.

**Generation options:** Aspect ratios `1:1`, `16:9`, `4:3`, `9:16`, `3:4`. Resolution `1MP` (default) or `4MP` (more detail, +30s). Pass `"sync": true` for a single generated image. Editing endpoints are the other way round —
they answer with a `status_url` you poll, and `"sync": true` on an edit fails with a gateway
timeout.

> **Advanced**: For precise control over generation, use the **vgl** skill for structured VGL JSON prompts instead of natural language.

See **[API Endpoints Reference](references/api-endpoints.md)** for full parameter documentation on all 20+ endpoints.

## Product Catalog Pipeline (batch)

When the user wants **listing-ready imagery for physical products at scale** — "build a product catalog from ./products", "turn this folder of photos into a catalog", "make these Amazon/Shopify/Etsy compliant" — use the bundled driver instead of calling endpoints one by one. It is **zero-config**: with no arguments it reads `./products` and writes `./catalog`.

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/build_catalog.py
```

Per product it runs **cutout → packshot + lifestyle scenes (+ dimensions) → marketplace variants** and writes `cutout.png`, `packshot.jpg`, `lifestyle_N.jpg`, `dimensions.png` (when measurements are available), per-channel variants, and a `listing.json` copy scaffold. Override only what you need:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/build_catalog.py \
  --input ./photos --output ./store \
  --scenes "clean marble surface, soft studio light|cozy wooden desk, warm morning light" \
  --variants amazon,shopify --dims ./dims.json
```

**Dimensions need real measurements — ask, don't guess.** With no measurements file and no `--no-dims`, the driver prints `NEEDS_DIMENSIONS` and exits (code 2). When that happens, stop and ask the user to either provide height/width (and optional weight/capacity) per product — as a `dims.json`/CSV — or re-run with `--no-dims` to skip only the dimensions image. Never fabricate sizes. `dims.json` format:

```json
{ "soap.jpg": {"title": "Hand Wash", "height_cm": 19, "width_cm": 6, "capacity_ml": 250} }
```

Store measurements in **cm** — callouts render dual **`cm / in`** automatically. Requires `pip install requests Pillow`.

### Marketplace-ready variants

`export_variants.py` turns one master image (packshot or cutout) into a compliant file per channel — enforcing background, aspect ratio, product fill, and minimum resolution:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/export_variants.py \
  --input ./catalog/soap/packshot.jpg --output ./catalog/soap --channels amazon,shopify,etsy
```

| Channel | Aspect | Background | Product fill | Min resolution |
|---------|--------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Amazon (main) | 1:1 | pure white `#FFFFFF` | ~85% | 1600 px (≥ 3000 ideal) |
| Shopify | 1:1 (+ 4:5) | white / transparent | ~90% | 2048 px |
| Etsy | 5:4 | white / lifestyle | ~85% | 2000 px |

Full rules: **[Marketplace Presets](references/marketplace-presets.md)**.

### Write the listing copy (SEO)

Bria generates images, not text — **you, the agent, write the copy**. `build_catalog.py` writes a `listing.json` scaffold per product; after the images are generated, **view each `packshot.jpg`** and fill it: `seo_title` (≤ 60 chars, keyword-first), `meta_description` (≤ 160 chars), `description` (1–2 paragraphs), `bullets` (4–6 benefit-led), `tags` (8–15 keywords). Ground every claim in what's visible — don't invent specs — and fold in any known dimensions.

## Prompt Engineering Tips

- **Style**: "professional product photography" vs "casual snapshot", "flat design illustration" vs "3D rendered"
- **Lighting**: "soft natural light", "studio lighting", "dramatic shadows"
- **Background**: "white studio", "gradient", "blurred office", "transparent"
- **Composition**: "centered", "rule of thirds", "negative space on left for text"
- **Quality keywords**: "high quality", "professional", "commercial grade", "4K", "sharp focus"
- **Negative prompts**: "blurry, low quality, pixelated", "text, watermark, logo"

### Recipes by Use Case

**Hero banner (16:9):** `"Modern tech startup workspace with developers collaborating, bright natural lighting, clean minimal aesthetic"` — include "clean background" or "minimal" for text overlay space

**Product photo (1:1):** `"Professional product photo of [item] on white studio background, soft shadows, commercial photography lighting"` — then remove background for transparent PNG

**Presentation visual (16:9):** `"Abstract visualization of data analytics, blue and purple gradient, modern corporate style, clean composition with space for text"` — common themes: "abstract technology", "business collaboration", "minimalist geometric patterns"

**Instagram post (1:1):** `"Lifestyle photo of coffee and laptop on wooden desk, morning light, cozy atmosphere"`

**Story/Reel (9:16):** `"Vertical product showcase of smartphone, floating in gradient background, tech aesthetic"`
