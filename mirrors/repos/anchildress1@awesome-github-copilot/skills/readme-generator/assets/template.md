## About

{{Two or three short paragraphs: what the project is, what problem it solves, who it's for, and at a high level how it works. No implementation details — those come later.}}

---

## Features

{{Pick one of the two layouts below. Delete the other.}}

**Table layout (best for \~3-7 features):**

| Feature | Description |
| - | - |
| {{Feature 1}} | {{One-line description}} |
| {{Feature 2}} | {{One-line description}} |
| {{Feature 3}} | {{One-line description}} |

**Subheading layout (best when each feature needs more explanation):**

### {{Feature 1}}

{{1-2 sentences. Stay at the level of *what it does*, not *how it works*.}}

### {{Feature 2}}

{{1-2 sentences.}}

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** {{e.g., TypeScript 5.x, Python 3.12, Go 1.22}}

## Architecture

{{Replace this Mermaid diagram with one that reflects your actual system. See `mermaid-examples.md` in this skill for more patterns.}}

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User([User])
    Web[Web App<br/>Next.js]
    API[API<br/>FastAPI]
    DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    Cache[(Redis)]
    Queue[Background Worker]

    User --> Web
    Web --> API
    API --> DB
    API --> Cache
    API --> Queue
    Queue --> DB
```

{{One short paragraph describing the flow: what each component does, how requests move through the system, where state lives. Keep it to what the diagram doesn't already show.}}

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- {{e.g., Node.js 20+}}
- {{e.g., Docker and Docker Compose}}
- {{e.g., A `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`)}}

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}.git
cd {{repo}}
{{install command, e.g., pnpm install}}
```

### Run locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env
{{any required setup, e.g., docker compose up -d postgres}}
{{run command, e.g., pnpm dev}}
```

The app should be available at `http://localhost:{{port}}`.

### Run the tests

```bash
{{e.g., pnpm test}}
```

> **Verify these steps yourself before publishing.** Missing one detail here is the most common reason a contributor gives up.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | — | Postgres connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | yes | — | Redis connection string |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | One of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `PORT` | no | `3000` | HTTP port the server binds to |
| `{{ANOTHER_VAR}}` | {{yes/no}} | {{default}} | {{description}} |

See `.env.example` for the canonical list.

---

## Security

- **Secrets:** never commit `.env`. Production secrets live in {{your secret manager}}.
- **Auth model:** {{e.g., session cookies issued by API, validated on every request}}.
- **Threat model:** {{a sentence or two about what you're defending against and what's out of scope}}.
- **Reporting vulnerabilities:** see `SECURITY.md`, or email {{security-contact}}.

When adding new features, follow the existing patterns for input validation, authorization checks, and secret handling. Don't bypass them "temporarily."

---

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Run the test suite locally and make sure it passes.
3. Open a pull request describing the change. Reference the issue it closes if applicable.
4. A maintainer will review within {{timeframe}}.

Commit messages follow {{convention, e.g., Conventional Commits}}. Code style is enforced by {{linter}}; run `{{lint command}}` before pushing.

For bigger changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

## What's Next

Planned work, in rough priority order:

- [ ] {{Upcoming feature 1}}
- [ ] {{Upcoming feature 2}}
- [ ] {{Tech debt item}}
- [ ] {{Quality-of-life improvement}}

Suggestions and contributions on any of these are welcome.
