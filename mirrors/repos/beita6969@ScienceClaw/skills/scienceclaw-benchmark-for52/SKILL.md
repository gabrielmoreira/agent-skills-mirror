# FoR52 — Psych-201 discrete

Use this skill for the `FoR52` adapter. The task metric is **micro accuracy**;
maximize is better. The adapter module is
`scienceclaw.bench.tasks.for52_psych201`.

## Tool surface

The adapter currently declares these tool references:

- `load_dev_inputs`
- `load_eval_inputs`
- `load_train`
- `psych_adaptive_predict`
- `psych_domain_adaptive_predict`
- `psych_fixed_predict`
- `score_dev`

Treat the list as a capability inventory, not permission to call every tool.
Select one frozen route plus a clearly named baseline, then record the exact
provenance and configuration used.

## Workflow

1. Read `docs/tasks/FoR52.md` and call `scienceclaw_bench` with
   `operation=catalog` before changing a route.
2. Build the candidate from visible `load_train` data and use `score_dev` or the
   documented visible split for selection. Keep the output shape, unit, and hard
   constraints from the adapter unchanged.
3. For mixed study pools, prefer `psych_domain_adaptive_predict` for the
   label-free route: it keeps q-learning for study IDs seen in training and
   uses the pooled GBDT branch for unseen study IDs. Use `psych_fixed_predict`
   as the incumbent comparison. The route is already strongest on the visible
   held-out-study pool; do not expose study targets or split flags to it.
4. Prefer an existing frozen checkpoint or remote wrapper. Do not train new
   weights, infer hidden targets, or use an evaluation item to choose a skill.
5. For self-evolution, let the solver produce a replayable graph, attribute the
   passing change to a skill/operator bundle, and validate it against the
   incumbent before promotion.
6. For formal work, use only an approved mutually exclusive launcher and record
   the manifest tag. If capacity or a compliant asset is missing, record the
   blocker instead of retrying an evaluated item.

See `skills/scienceclaw-benchmark/references/protocol.md` for the shared
promotion and evidence contract.
