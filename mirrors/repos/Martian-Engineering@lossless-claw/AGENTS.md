# Repository Instructions

## PR Review And Merge

- Before merging a PR, check whether it changes user-facing behavior or should appear in npm release notes.
- If yes, make sure a maintainer adds a `.changeset/*.md` file before merge or immediately after in a follow-up PR.
- Do not expect external contributors to know or run the Changesets workflow.
- Use the smallest appropriate bump:
  - `patch`: fixes, compatibility work, docs-visible behavior changes
  - `minor`: new features or notable new behavior
  - `major`: breaking changes
- Treat a PR as not release-ready until the changeset question has been answered.
