# Bevy audio systems

## When to use

Load this when a clip should start, loop, pause, or change volume. `bevy::audio` on docs.rs `latest` (0.20.0) and the `audio_control` example there are the sources.

## ECS shape

- **Play:** spawn `AudioPlayer::new(asset_server.load(...))`. `AudioPlayer<Source>` holds `Handle<Source>` where `Source: Asset + Decodable`. If the asset is not ready, playback starts when it is. `AudioPlayer` requires `PlaybackSettings`.
- **Settings:** `PlaybackSettings` configures the start. `PlaybackSettings::LOOP` and `.with_spatial(true)` appear in the spatial examples. Changes to `PlaybackSettings` do not affect audio that is already playing. `PlaybackMode` is `Once`, `Loop`, `Despawn`, or `Remove`.
- **Control:** when playback begins, Bevy inserts `AudioSink`. The control example queries `AudioSink` and calls `pause`, `toggle_mute`, `set_volume`, `set_speed`, and `position`. `SpatialAudioSink` is the spatial counterpart named on the playback page.
- **Replay:** after a non-looping sound finishes and the sink is drained, that `AudioPlayer` cannot be reused. Remove the audio components and add them again.
- **Schedule:** spawn on `Startup` or from a system that has `Res<AssetServer>` and `Commands`. Control systems in the example run where they read `ButtonInput<KeyCode>` and `Res<Time>`.

## Coming from Godot

| Godot idea | Bevy idiom |
| --- | --- |
| Play a file | `AudioPlayer::new` plus `AssetServer::load` |
| Loop | `PlaybackSettings::LOOP` |
| Pause / mute / volume while playing | `AudioSink` methods on the same entity |
| One-shot that should leave the world | `PlaybackMode::Despawn` or `Remove` |
| Positional emitter | `PlaybackSettings` with `with_spatial(true)` and `SpatialAudioSink` |

## Scope

- Check the audio docs for bus graphs, music/sfx mixer layouts, and audio-area shapes before writing them.
- Check the audio docs for sample rates, supported file types, and the `AudioSource` type beyond the `Handle` in `AudioPlayer::new`.
- Removing `AudioSink` restarts an attached source (stated on the sink page). Check that page for a full restart recipe before writing one.

## Expert Knowledge Delta

Target: **Bevy 0.20+**.

Core ECS types: `Component`, `Resource`, `Query`, `Commands`, `Startup`, `Update`, `Fixed` / `FixedMain` (`bevy::time`), `.chain()`, `Plugin`, `DefaultPlugins`, `MinimalPlugins`. Messages and observers are an ownership slot. See `bevy-events-messaging` for their APIs. Systems run in parallel unless `.chain()` orders the ones that conflict.

### Who owns state

| Piece | Owner | Who may mutate | Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data on one entity | `Component` | One system via `Query` | `Update` or `FixedMain` |
| One value for the whole app | `Resource` | One system | `Startup` to insert, then the schedule that reads it |
| Spawn | `Commands` | The spawning system | `Startup` for the initial world; later schedules for runtime spawn |
| Order that must not race | `.chain()` | The chained systems only | Same schedule |
| Plugin boundary | `Plugin` | `build` registers systems and resources | Before the app runs |

Borrow rule: two systems that both mutably query the same component must be ordered (`.chain()`) or split so only one writes. Unrelated systems stay parallel. That is the ECS page rule, not a guess at a system-set API.

### Decision

| If you need | Do this | Do not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-entity data | `Component` + `Query` | A Godot node script |
| App-wide config or clock | `Resource` | Copy the value onto every entity |
| Stable simulation step | `FixedMain` and the `Fixed` clock | Tie simulation to raw frame `Update` |
| Startup spawn | `Commands` in `Startup` | Spawn from a render system |
| Cross-system notice that is not shared state | Message or observer slot in `bevy-events-messaging` | A new event type invented in this file |
| An API outside the documented set | Check the official docs first | A made-up crate or API |

## NEVER

- Do not pin `/0.20.0/` in docs URLs. WHY: links stay on `latest`; the 0.20 target is stated once in prose.
- Do not mutably query the same component from two unordered systems. WHY: the schedule runs systems in parallel unless `.chain()` orders them.
- Do not invent a physics, navigation, networking, or XR crate here. WHY: this skill only names documented Bevy crates and modules.

- No Godot audio player, bus, or stream types. WHY: Bevy code stays idiomatic ECS and uses only documented Bevy APIs.
- No volume curves or mixer nodes this file did not open. WHY: Bevy code stays idiomatic ECS and uses only documented Bevy APIs.
- No third-party audio crates. WHY: Bevy code stays idiomatic ECS and uses only documented Bevy APIs.

## Reference

docs.rs links use the unversioned `latest` permalink. The library pin on bevy-master stays **0.20.0**.
