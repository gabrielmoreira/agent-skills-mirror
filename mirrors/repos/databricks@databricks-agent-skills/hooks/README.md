# Plugin hooks

Three hooks make sure Databricks work flows through the skills. All are
stdlib-only Python and **fail open** (any error prints `{}` / no output and
exits 0, so a broken hook never blocks a prompt, session start, or tool call).
`hooks.json` wires them in; Claude Code expands `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. Claude
Code auto-loads `hooks/hooks.json`, so it is **not** declared in `plugin.json`
(declaring the standard path double-loads it and fails the plugin).

**The four hook-wiring files (`hooks.json`, `codex-hooks.json`,
`copilot-hooks.json`, `cursor-hooks.json`) are generated** from
`plugin.meta.json` (the `hooks` block + each target's `hooks_render`) by
`scripts/skills.py`. They are the same three logical hooks rendered into each
runtime's dialect (schema shape, event-name casing, env var, command form, tool
matcher, and whether the router is wired). To change hook wiring, edit
`plugin.meta.json` and run `python3 scripts/skills.py generate`; do not
hand-edit these JSON files (CI fails on drift). The hook *scripts* (`*.py`) are
hand-written; only the wiring JSON is generated.

`cursor-hooks.json` wires the Cursor plugin and **is** declared explicitly (as
`"hooks"` in `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`), because Cursor's default plugin
discovery would otherwise parse the Claude-format `hooks.json`. It runs the
context primer (`sessionStart`) and the auth hinter (`postToolUse`, matcher
`Shell`) with `--platform cursor`, which switches the scripts' output envelope
to Cursor's `additional_context` and renders the Cursor command names
(`/databricks-setup`, `/databricks-doctor`) in the injected text. The
prompt-router hook is not wired on Cursor (`beforeSubmitPrompt` can block a
prompt but cannot inject context). Routing instead ships as a Cursor **rule**
(`rules/databricks-routing.mdc`, declared via `"rules"` in
`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`): an Apply-Intelligently rule whose description
triggers it on Databricks-related prompts and injects the same product-skill
table the Claude/Codex router uses. This is load-bearing because Cursor
currently drops `additional_context` from `sessionStart`/`postToolUse` for
non-MCP tools (open upstream bug, Cursor forum #155689 / #158452), so the primer
and auth-hint hooks are effectively no-ops on Cursor today; the rule loads
through the rules engine, not the hook-injection path, so it is unaffected.
Native skill selection also helps.

`copilot-hooks.json` wires the GitHub Copilot plugin (declared as `"hooks"` in
`.github/plugin/plugin.json`). It uses PascalCase event names, which selects
Copilot's Claude-compatible payload dialect, so the scripts run unchanged and
emit the Claude output envelope. Only two hooks are wired: the context primer
(`SessionStart`) and the auth hinter (`PostToolUse`). Copilot's hooks run on the
Copilot CLI and the cloud agent (VS Code ships its own separate hooks system);
the CLI injects `SessionStart` / `PostToolUse` `additionalContext` as of Copilot
CLI v1.0.11 (earlier versions dropped session-start output).
The prompt router is not wired: no Copilot surface lets a prompt-submit hook
inject context (`userPromptSubmitted` output is not processed), so routing rides
on skill descriptions and instruction files.
Each entry carries `bash` and `powershell` command variants per Copilot's hook
format.

`codex-hooks.json` wires the Codex plugin and **is** declared explicitly (as
`"hooks"` in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`), because Codex's default plugin hook
file is `hooks/hooks.json`, the Claude wiring. Codex uses Claude's event names
and payload/output schema, so all three scripts run unchanged. Script paths
resolve via the `PLUGIN_ROOT` env var Codex exports to hook processes (with
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` as fallback; Codex exports both). Codex hash-pins plugin
hooks: users approve them via `/hooks` after install and after every update,
and enterprises can pre-trust them through managed `requirements.toml` hooks.

Each hook is pinned by a test file in `tests/` at the repo root; run the whole
suite with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*_test.py'`.

## `databricks-router.py`: prompt router (UserPromptSubmit)

Runs a fast keyword regex (sub-50ms, no LLM, no network) over each user prompt.
When the prompt is Databricks-related, it injects an `additionalContext`
instruction telling Claude to load `databricks-core` plus the matching product
skill before answering. When it isn't, it prints `{}` and stays out of the way.

The full instruction is injected **once per session** (tracked by a marker file
in the temp dir keyed on the payload's `session_id`); later Databricks prompts
in the same session get a one-line reminder instead, so long sessions don't pay
the full routing block on every turn.

There's no second agent to delegate to. Claude itself drives the `databricks`
CLI through the skills, so "routing" just means "make sure the Databricks skills
are loaded." There is **no permission gating and no cost warning** here.

Precision is tuned to avoid over-routing:

- **STRONG** terms (`databricks`, `unity catalog`, `lakeflow`, `dbfs`,
  `databricks.yml`, `spark declarative pipelines`, `delta live tables` (the
  legacy name still routes), ...) always route, even alongside an
  alternative-platform mention, so "migrate from redshift to databricks" routes.
- **AMBIGUOUS** terms (`declarative pipelines`, `model serving`, `vector
  search`, `mlflow`, `pyspark`, `genie`, ...) route only when no **SUPPRESS**
  term is present.
- **SUPPRESS** terms (alternative data platforms, Jenkins, and plainly-local
  dev work like `git commit`, `read the file`, `unit test`, `npm`) hold back an
  ambiguous match.
- **URLs**: code-hosting URLs are blanked before matching, so `databricks`
  appearing only as a GitHub/GitLab org or repo name
  (`github.com/databricks/...`) does not route. URLs whose hostname contains
  `databricks` (workspace and docs hosts) still do.

These three lists, plus the injected instruction, live in `plugin.meta.json`'s
`routing` block and are generated into `_routing_data.json` (next to this
script), which the router loads at import. To change them, edit
`plugin.meta.json` and run `python3 scripts/skills.py generate`; do not
hand-edit `_routing_data.json`. If that file is ever missing or unreadable the
router falls back to a minimal inline config that routes only literal
`databricks` mentions (fail-open), so an install that loses it keeps working but
loses product-keyword routing until it is restored. Behavior is pinned by
`tests/databricks_router_test.py`.

## `databricks-context.py`: context primer (SessionStart)

Injects a compact banner at session start: the routing rule (load
`databricks-core` + the product skill), CLI presence + version, configured
profile names plus any `[__settings__].default_profile` (parsed from
`~/.databrickscfg` locally, **no network call**, token values never printed),
and whether env/in-platform auth is set. If the CLI isn't installed it points
at `/databricks:setup`.
Covered by `tests/databricks_context_test.py`.

Its `hooks.json` entry uses `"matcher": "startup|clear|compact"`: the banner
fires for new sessions, `/clear`, and after compaction, but **not on resume**,
where the prior context already contains it.

## `databricks-auth-helper.py`: auth-failure hint (PostToolUse)

Watches Bash tool results (matcher: `Bash`). When a `databricks` command's
output matches a phrase-shaped auth-failure signal (missing default
credentials, `invalid_grant`, `401 unauthorized`, invalid/expired token), it
injects one line suggesting `/databricks:doctor` or `databricks auth login`
before any retry. It never blocks or rewrites tool calls; bare status codes in
ordinary output do not trigger it. Only commands that actually **invoke** the
`databricks` executable count: `databricks` appearing as a repo path, URL, or
argument (`gh pr view --repo databricks/cli`) does not, since such output can
legitimately quote auth-failure phrases without any auth problem.
Covered by `tests/databricks_auth_helper_test.py`.

## Distribution note

These ship with the Claude Code plugin (the whole repo is the plugin via
`marketplace.json` `source: "./"`), with the GitHub Copilot plugin (primer +
auth hinter via `copilot-hooks.json`, catalogued in
`.github/plugin/marketplace.json`), and with the Codex plugin (all three hooks
via `codex-hooks.json`, catalogued in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`). The
Cursor marketplace plugin (`databricks`) ships the context primer and auth
hinter via `cursor-hooks.json` plus the routing rule
(`rules/databricks-routing.mdc`); the router hook stays Claude/Codex-only. The
Copilot cloud agent takes no plugins; it only reads hooks vendored into the
target repo's `.github/hooks/`. The Databricks CLI install path
(`databricks aitools install`) currently packages **skills only**. See the repo
README for the parity follow-up.
