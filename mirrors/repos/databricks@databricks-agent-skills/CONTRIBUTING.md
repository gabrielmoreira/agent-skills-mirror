## Skill anatomy

Every skill — stable (`skills/<name>/`) or experimental (`experimental/<name>/`) — ships the same set of files:

```
<name>/
├── SKILL.md                         # required: skill prose + frontmatter
├── references/*.md                  # optional: supporting reference content
├── agents/openai.yaml               # required: Codex marketplace metadata
└── assets/
    ├── databricks.svg               # required: icon (Codex marketplace)
    └── databricks.png               # required: icon (Codex marketplace)
```

**`SKILL.md`** is what every coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Copilot, Antigravity) reads. Frontmatter carries `name`, `description`, and optional `metadata.version` + `parent`.

**`agents/openai.yaml`** is Codex CLI's plugin-marketplace metadata format: `display_name`, `short_description`, `icon_small`, `icon_large`, `brand_color`, `default_prompt`. It controls how the skill renders in Codex's in-app marketplace. Other agents ignore this file. The repo ships it for every skill so the manifest is a single feed for all agents.

**`assets/databricks.{svg,png}`** are the icons referenced by `agents/openai.yaml`'s `icon_small` / `icon_large`. Identical across all skills (the Databricks logo); `scripts/skills.py` copies them in from the repo-root `/assets/`.

### Adding or updating a skill

`scripts/skills.py generate` (and `sync`) auto-synthesise both `agents/openai.yaml` and the icons for any skill that's missing them. Hand-authored `agents/openai.yaml` is preserved as-is, so you can curate the display name / short description / default prompt before running `generate` — the synthesiser only writes when the file is absent.

If the synthesised display name comes out wrong (e.g. acronyms or product names that get mis-cased by hyphen-titlecasing), add an entry to `DISPLAY_NAME_OVERRIDES` in `scripts/skills.py` rather than hand-authoring the whole `openai.yaml`.

**Workflow for a new skill**:

```bash
# 1. Create the skill directory + SKILL.md (and references/ if needed).
mkdir -p skills/databricks-foo/references
$EDITOR skills/databricks-foo/SKILL.md      # write SKILL.md with frontmatter

# 2. For stable skills only: add the skill to plugin.meta.json "skills"
#    with a "keyword" (this is its Claude/Codex plugin marketplace keyword).

# 3. Generate Codex metadata + icons + manifest in one shot.
python3 scripts/skills.py generate

# 4. Confirm validate passes (this is what CI runs).
python3 scripts/skills.py validate
```

`generate` is idempotent — re-running it never overwrites your `SKILL.md`, `references/`, or hand-edited `agents/openai.yaml`; it only fills in what's missing.

### CI

`.github/workflows/validate-manifest.yml` runs `python3 scripts/skills.py validate` on every PR that touches the skills, the generator, `metaplugin/plugin.meta.json`, any plugin manifest dir (`.claude-plugin/**`, `.codex-plugin/**`, `.github/plugin/**`, `.cursor-plugin/**`, `.agents/**`), `hooks/**`, the command dirs, or `rules/**`. Validation enforces:

- Every skill has `agents/openai.yaml`.
- Every skill ships `assets/databricks.svg` + `assets/databricks.png` byte-identical to the repo-root source.
- `manifest.json` matches what `scripts/skills.py generate` would produce.
- Every stable skill has a `plugin.meta.json` "skills" entry (and vice versa).
- Every target's `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` is byte-identical to what the generator produces from `plugin.meta.json` (no drift across the four targets).

If validation fails the error tells you which file is missing or stale; the fix is always `python3 scripts/skills.py generate` and committing the result.

## Plugin metadata (`metaplugin/plugin.meta.json`)

The repo ships one logical plugin to four targets (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot,
Cursor) plus a marketplace catalog for three of them. All cross-target plugin
metadata, version, name, description, author, license, keywords, per-target
display names, and hook/command/rule wiring, lives once in
**`metaplugin/plugin.meta.json`**. `scripts/skills.py generate` renders it into
every target's
`plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`:

- `.claude-plugin/{plugin,marketplace}.json`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` + `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
- `.github/plugin/{plugin,marketplace}.json`
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`

**Edit `metaplugin/plugin.meta.json`, then run `python3 scripts/skills.py generate`.** Never
hand-edit the generated files; CI re-renders them in memory and fails on any byte
drift. (The generated JSON carries no "do-not-edit" comment key because the
plugin loaders / the Claude marketplace `$schema` reject unknown keys; their
generated status is documented here and enforced by the drift check.)

The generator lives in `scripts/skillsgen/` (a package split by concern);
`scripts/skills.py` is a thin façade that re-exports its API and is the CLI entry
point. To change or add a *hook* specifically, see `hooks/README.md`
("Changing or adding a hook") — the hook scripts are shared and hand-written,
the per-target wiring JSON is generated.

The plugin keyword list is composed as `keywords_lead + [each skill's keyword] +
keywords_tail`, in the insertion order of the `skills` map. The plugin `name` is
`databricks` for every target and is load-bearing (it keys Cursor/Claude
installs); the generator never emits a different value.

The `routing` block in `plugin.meta.json` is also generated output: the
product-skill table there is rendered into both the prompt router's data
(`hooks/_routing_data.json`, which `hooks/databricks-router.py` loads) and the
Cursor rule (`rules/databricks-routing.mdc`), so the two routing tables cannot
drift. Add a product skill and CI fails until it has a `routing.table` row.
Regenerate the same way: edit `metaplugin/plugin.meta.json`, run `scripts/skills.py generate`.

The four hook-wiring files (`hooks/hooks.json`, `codex-hooks.json`,
`copilot-hooks.json`, `cursor-hooks.json`) are generated from the `hooks` block
+ each target's `hooks_render` (the same three logical hooks rendered into each
runtime's dialect). Edit `metaplugin/plugin.meta.json` and regenerate; only the wiring JSON
is generated, the hook `*.py` scripts are hand-written.

## Plugin components (hooks + commands)

The Claude Code plugin ships more than skills:

- `hooks/`: `hooks.json` wires a UserPromptSubmit prompt router
  (`databricks-router.py`) that steers Databricks-related prompts into the
  skills, a SessionStart context primer (`databricks-context.py`), and a
  PostToolUse auth-failure hinter (`databricks-auth-helper.py`). All
  stdlib-only and fail-open. See [`hooks/README.md`](./hooks/README.md). Each
  hook's behavior is pinned by its matching `tests/*_test.py` file; run the
  suite with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*_test.py'`.
  **`hooks/hooks.json` is auto-loaded by Claude Code, so do NOT add a `"hooks"`
  key to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, or the plugin fails to load with a
  "Duplicate hooks file" error.**
- `commands/`: one `*.md` per slash command (`/databricks:<name>`), declared via
  `"commands"` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Each needs frontmatter
  (`description`, optional `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`).

`scripts/skills.py validate` (run in CI) checks that `hooks/hooks.json` is valid
JSON referencing scripts that exist, that plugin.json does not double-declare the
standard hooks file, and that every command carries a `description` (quoted if it
contains a `:`, since strict YAML rejects unquoted colons). The validate
workflow also runs all hook test files.

These components ship via the plugin marketplace (the whole repo is the plugin).
`databricks aitools install` packages `skills/` only today; extending it to
hooks/commands is CLI-side follow-up work.

## Security

Please see [SECURITY](./SECURITY) for vulnerability reporting guidelines.

## Documentation Safety

Examples in skills and references must follow secure defaults:

- Use least-privilege permissions — don't suggest `ALL PRIVILEGES` when a narrower grant suffices
- If an example requires elevated permissions, state it explicitly (e.g. "requires workspace admin")
- Prefer scoped tokens over broad credentials
- Obfuscate sensitive values: use placeholder workspace IDs (`1111111111111111`), URLs (`company-workspace.cloud.databricks.com`), and never include real tokens or passwords

## Releasing

Releases are cut by the **Release** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`),
triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) with a `vX.Y.Z` tag. The workflow:

1. Runs `scripts/bump_version.py <version>`, which sets the `version` field in
   `plugin.meta.json` (the single source) and regenerates every target's
   `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` and `manifest.json` from it, so all four
   targets carry the same version.
2. Commits the bump (`plugin.meta.json` + the regenerated manifests) to `main`.
3. Creates an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag (`git tag -a`) at that commit, pushes it,
   then creates the GitHub release (`gh release create --verify-tag`).

Bumping the plugin `version` on every release is **required**: Claude Code's
plugin marketplace keys updates on the `version` field, so a release that ships
without bumping it leaves marketplace clients on the cached copy and they never
see the new skills.

After releasing, open a follow-up PR to update
[`cli-compat.json`](#version-resolution-in-databricks-cli) in the CLI repo so
`databricks aitools install` resolves to the new version.

## Version resolution in Databricks CLI

The Databricks CLI uses [`cli-compat.json`](https://github.com/databricks/cli/blob/main/internal/build/cli-compat.json)
to determine which Agent Skills version to install for `aitools install`. The manifest maps
CLI versions to compatible Agent Skills versions. It lives in the
[CLI repository](https://github.com/databricks/cli) — see the
[README](https://github.com/databricks/cli/blob/main/internal/build/README.md) for details.
