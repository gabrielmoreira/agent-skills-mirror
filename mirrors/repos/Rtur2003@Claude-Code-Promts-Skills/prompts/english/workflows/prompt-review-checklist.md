# Prompt Review Checklist

Use this checklist for periodic prompt quality reviews.

---

## Review Cadence

- Monthly: review recently edited prompts
- Quarterly: review all active prompts in `prompts/english/agents/`

---

## Mandatory Structure Check

- [ ] `## Role` exists (one or two sentences)
- [ ] A protocol section exists — `## Protocol: <ACRONYM>` or `## <Name> Protocol` — mapping to the phases
- [ ] Phase sections exist (`## Phase 1: …`, `## Phase 2: …`, or a single `## Phases`) with actionable `- [ ]` checklists or step lists
- [ ] `## Remember` exists and is the final section
- [ ] Agent prompts: a `**Use this when:**` line and a `**Skip to:**` anchor list under the subtitle, anchors resolving to real headings
- [ ] There is a row for this prompt in `.claude/skills/find-prompt/SKILL.md`
- [ ] No stale versions or Claude model IDs stated from memory (see the Currency Rule in CONTRIBUTING.md)

---

## No Vague Advice Check

For each recommendation in the prompt:

- [ ] Ends with a concrete decision, or
- [ ] Names a concrete tool, or
- [ ] Includes a concrete validation step

Fail the review if a recommendation is generic without an action.

---

## Outcome & Clarity Check

- [ ] Prompt scope is explicit (what it should and should not do)
- [ ] Steps are ordered and executable
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Internal links resolve
