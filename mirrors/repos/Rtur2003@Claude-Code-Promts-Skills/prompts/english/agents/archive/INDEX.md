# Archived Agent Prompts

> Historical prompts moved out of the active catalog to reduce overlap and improve prompt selection speed.

## Archive Policy

A prompt is archived when at least one of these is true:
- It duplicates guidance already covered by `claude-agent-system-prompt.md`.
- A newer specialist prompt provides better, more complete coverage.
- It adds selection friction without clear incremental outcome value.

## Keep / Merge / Archive Decisions

| Prompt | Status | Merged Into | Reason |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Error Analysis | Archive | Debugging & Troubleshooting + Agent System | Overlaps with production debugging flow and root-cause loop |
| Project Workflow | Archive | Agent System + Technology Stack + Full-Stack Development | Lifecycle planning is now covered by core + stack-specific prompts |
| Integration Guardian | Archive | Code Review + Testing + Monitoring & Observability | Cross-cutting integrity checks are distributed in stronger specialist prompts |
| Claude Code Token Optimization | Archive | Claude Code Modes + Claude Code Workflow | Token strategy is now embedded in mode and workflow guidance |
| Prompt Chaining | Archive | Agent System + Multi-Agent Orchestration | Multi-step planning is handled by core loop and orchestration prompt |
