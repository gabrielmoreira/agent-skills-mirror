# Publish Skills

Publish current catalog content and repair every selected source-owned global installation and CLI-lock drift.

## Scope

Default to every candidate reported by `scripts/publish-skills.ts`. Do not reconstruct a last-published Git boundary and
do not use the current transcript as one.

When the user explicitly names a commit range, resolve the range to commits reachable from the current branch, collect
only paths matching `skills/<name>/...`, validate and de-duplicate the kebab-case names, and pass each name as a
repeated `--skill <name>` filter in every planner, apply, and final-check command. Treat a rename as the old and new
names. Stop if the range or ownership is ambiguous.

## Workflow

### 1. Plan Current Drift

From the source repository, run:

```bash
bun run scripts/publish-skills.ts plan --json
```

Append the resolved `--skill` filters only for explicit commit-range mode. The planner is read-only and reports content,
executable-bit, target-layout, symlink, deletion, and CLI metadata drift. If it reports no drift and there are no
attributable source changes to commit, report the no-op and stop.

### 2. Commit and Push Source Changes

If attributable source changes are uncommitted, invoke `$commit --push` from the source repository without `--all` and
include only those paths. `$commit` owns semantic message composition; its `ai-commit` backend owns deterministic
transaction, commit, and push mechanics. If the worktree is clean but `main` is ahead, run `ai-commit push`. A `BEHIND`
receipt means the source is not propagated: stop before changing global installations and report that branch
reconciliation is required. Otherwise, do not change global installations until the source commit and push succeed.

Re-run the same planner command after the push. Record the exact source HEAD:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

### 3. Claim Target Repositories

Use the refreshed planner's non-empty groups to derive every installed skill directory that `apply` can change. Claim
only those directories, grouped by their containing Git repository:

- `shared`: `~/.agents/skills/<name>` and `~/.claude/skills/<name>`.
- `claude`: `~/.claude/skills/<name>`.
- `codex`: `~/.agents/skills/<name>`.
- `remove`: every existing target directory for the named skill that the planner reports.

For each affected target that is a Git repository, run its normal coordination preflight from that repository root, then
claim the derived repository-relative directories before applying:

```bash
git status --short
ai-coord status
ai-coord start 'publish-skills targets' \
  --recursive 'skills/<name-a>' \
  --recursive 'skills/<name-b>'
```

Require `READY` for every target claim before `apply`. On a dirty-settling hold or conflict, use the normal
`ai-coord wait` flow. If the planner changes while waiting, release obsolete claims, re-plan, and claim the refreshed
target set. The CLI state lock is not a repository scope: its exclusive process lock already serializes it, and it is
never a commit path.

Keep target claims until the corresponding reported repository changes are committed and pushed, or until that target
has no Git diff. Release each with `ai-coord done` before re-planning a partial apply or after finalization.

### 4. Apply Once

Run one guarded apply with the recorded full SHA and the same optional filters:

```bash
bun run scripts/publish-skills.ts apply --expected-head <full-sha>
```

Do not issue separate `bunx skills` commands or edit the CLI lock. The helper requires clean selected source paths,
`main` equal to its upstream and the expected HEAD, readable v3 lock metadata, and an exclusive process lock. It removes
only deleted or stale entries and target-restriction changes, batches at most one add per target group, verifies the
result, and prints every global path whose final state changed.

If apply fails after partial progress, preserve its completed-command list. Commit and push only its reported repository
paths, then re-plan and retry the remaining drift once with the same expected HEAD. A second failure blocks publication;
report the failed command, completed groups, and changed paths.

### 5. Commit and Push Reported Global Paths

Group `Changed global paths` under `~/.agents` and `~/.claude`. In each repository with a reported diff, invoke
`$commit --push` under its already-held target claim and pass only the reported skill paths as session-modified paths,
including deletions. Never acquire a new claim after `apply`, or include unreported skills, unrelated dirty paths, or
the CLI state lock. Skip repositories with no reported diff.

### 6. Require a Clean Final Check

Run the same selected scope through:

```bash
bun run scripts/publish-skills.ts check
```

Completion requires zero selected content, mode, target, deletion, symlink, or lock-metadata drift and successful pushes
for every source or global repository commit created by this workflow. `BEHIND` is safe noncompletion, not successful
propagation.

## Report

Report the source and global commit receipts, introduced or refreshed names, deleted names, and the final clean-check
result. Omit repositories and target groups that had no changes.
