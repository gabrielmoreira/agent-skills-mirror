# Sync Skills

Review skill files that intentionally share wording, policies, or helper contracts. Patch only real drift; preserve
skill-specific behavior and examples.

## Scope

Default: run every sync group below. If the request names a group, file, or subset, run only that group.

Work only in the files listed for the selected groups.

## Sync Groups

### Commit Message Format Helpers

Files:

- `skills/commit/scripts/prepare-commit.sh`
- `skills/commit/scripts/select-message-format.sh`

Treat these as in scope:

- The ordered literal entries in each `always_natural_language_repos` array. The variable names may differ, but the repo
  path list must stay identical.
- The rule that `--natural` forces `natural`.
- The default fallback to `conventional` when the target repo is not in the always-natural list.

Treat these as out of scope unless the request explicitly names them:

- Atomic staging behavior in `prepare-commit.sh`.
- Backwards-compatible argument parsing in `select-message-format.sh`.
- Adding a shared sourced helper file.

### Handoff Planning Guidance

Files:

- `skills/codex-handoff/SKILL.md`
- `skills/claude-handoff/SKILL.md`

Both skills plan in Claude Code Plan mode and delegate implementation to subagents; only the agent runtime differs
(Codex CLI runner vs Claude Code Agent tool). Treat these shared blocks as in scope and keep them semantically
identical, adjusted only for the agent noun and runtime:

- Contract bullets: the Plan-mode gate, Claude's ownership of planning and orchestration, the no-redesign rule for
  agents, the smallest-effective-team and five-agent limits, and Claude's implementation work being limited to
  orchestration, integrity checks, failure handling, and the conditional polish pass.
- Strategy selection guidance: sequential vs parallel vs hybrid criteria, disjoint-write-scope requirement, wave
  semantics, the slowest-agent note, and the whole-handoff five-agent limit with stable IDs and dependencies.
- The single-validation-owner rule: aggregate checks run once; every other agent runs only the narrowest checks proving
  its own edits; aggregate-check failures confined to files outside every agent's scope are attributed to unrelated
  concurrent work, not treated as blockers.
- The `$code-polish` trigger list, including "file count alone is not a trigger".
- Platform-agnostic agent prompt requirements: outcome plus brief, exact write scope and dirty-work boundaries,
  validation assignment, authority boundary, stopping rule, and reporting requirement.
- Completion rules: success verification, dependent gating on failure, changed-files union dedupe, polish invocation and
  skip conditions, and cross-repository `$commit` behavior.

Treat these as out of scope unless the request explicitly names them:

- Launch mechanics: `run-codex-handoff.sh` and its artifacts vs Agent-tool calls.
- Codex-only content: effort and timeout selection, progress streams, Monitor guidance, sentinel handling, and Codex
  command conventions.
- Each skill's model selection table and its rules about escalating or re-running a failed agent on another model. Both
  skills have a selection table, but they are intentionally different — Codex tiers model, effort, and timeout together,
  while Claude selects only between two model aliases — so never normalize them to each other.
- Status reporting: codex-handoff's dashboard system vs claude-handoff's concise prose summary.
- Frontmatter and `references/`/`scripts/` contents.

Verification is prose comparison of the in-scope blocks; there is no extractable helper data.

## Workflow

1. Verify repository context: `git rev-parse --git-dir`. If this fails, stop and tell the user to run from a git
   repository.
2. Resolve selected sync groups once. Do not broaden the group list after reading files unless the user asks.
3. Read the selected files and compare only the in-scope shared blocks or helper contracts.
4. When drift exists, normalize all copies to one phrasing or value set. Reuse the clearest wording already present.
5. Prefer minimal patches. Do not rewrite whole sections just to make them symmetrical if the remaining differences are
   skill-specific.
6. If no drift exists, make no edits and report that the selected groups are already aligned.

## Verification

After editing Markdown, run from the repo root:

```bash
just prettier-write
just prettier-check
```

For the Commit Message Format Helpers group, run:

```bash
bash -n skills/commit/scripts/prepare-commit.sh skills/commit/scripts/select-message-format.sh
bash <<'EOF'
set -euo pipefail
extract_repos() {
  awk '
    /always_natural_language_repos=\(/ { in_list=1; next }
    in_list && /^[[:space:]]*\)/ { exit }
    in_list {
      line=$0
      sub(/^[[:space:]]*"/, "", line)
      sub(/"[[:space:]]*$/, "", line)
      if (line != "") print line
    }
  ' "$1"
}
diff -u \
  <(extract_repos skills/commit/scripts/prepare-commit.sh) \
  <(extract_repos skills/commit/scripts/select-message-format.sh)
EOF
```

Re-read touched sections and confirm selected groups now match on shared wording or helper data and still differ only
where their workflows require it.
