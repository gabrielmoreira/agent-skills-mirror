# Progress Stream Reference

When `run-codex-handoff.sh` is invoked with `--progress-file PATH`, the file is a live JSONL stream. It contains every
line Codex emits under `codex exec --json`, followed by one wrapper-authored sentinel. Pre-launch validation failures
exit nonzero before the stream exists. Those failures write no sentinel. After the run starts, the wrapper writes
exactly one sentinel.

Tail the stream for real-time watching and post-mortems. Pass `--result-file PATH` separately to keep the final
structured result in an artifact and leave background-task stdout empty.

Sessions persist. Record the `thread.started` session ID. Then pass `--resume SESSION_ID` to continue that session with
the same wrapper controls and a new stdin prompt.

## Codex events

Codex emits one JSON object per line. Each has a top-level `type`
([non-interactive mode docs](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/non-interactive-mode)):

| Event                                              | Meaning                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `thread.started`, `turn.started`                   | Session/turn lifecycle                                                 |
| `turn.completed`                                   | The turn finished. The event includes `usage`, such as `output_tokens` |
| `turn.failed`                                      | The turn failed. The event includes error details                      |
| `item.started` / `item.updated` / `item.completed` | Work items. `item.type` identifies the activity                        |
| `error`                                            | Unrecoverable stream error. The wrapper still owns settlement          |

Item types in Codex CLI 0.156.1: `agent_message` (assistant text), `reasoning`, `command_execution` (has `command` and
`status`), `file_change`, `mcp_tool_call`, `collab_tool_call`, `web_search`, `todo_list` (plan updates), and `error`
(non-fatal item error)
([0.156.1 event definitions](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.156.1/codex-rs/exec/src/exec_events.rs)).
Example:

```json
{ "type": "item.completed", "item": { "id": "item_3", "type": "agent_message", "text": "Repo contains docs and sdk." } }
```

### Intentional visibility gap

The app-server protocol documents separate `model/safetyBuffering/updated` and `model/rerouted` notifications
([turn events](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app-server#turn-events)), but they are not part of the documented
`codex exec --json` event set. This distinction was verified against Codex CLI 0.156.1. Later versions may differ. Treat
the forwarded event set as version-dependent, not guaranteed. Do not invent equivalent JSONL events or infer a safety
check from silence. A quiet period may be ordinary work or transient buffering, and an independent server-side policy
reroute may leave the responding model unknowable.

In status digests, say `no recent activity` and keep watching until the wrapper sentinel or approved timeout. Do not
cancel, retry, extend, downgrade to a suggested faster model, or relaunch because the stream is quiet. Preserve normal
timeout and failure handling.

## Wrapper sentinel

The wrapper appends exactly one terminal line per run. Its presence, rather than process state, is the completion
signal:

| Sentinel                                                                | Emitted when                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{"type":"handoff.completed","elapsed_seconds":N,"output_tokens":M}`    | Success. The token count is the last `turn.completed` value (thread-cumulative total) |
| `{"type":"handoff.failed","reason":"timeout","elapsed_seconds":N}`      | Wrapper timeout hit                                                                   |
| `{"type":"handoff.failed","reason":"error","rc":R,"elapsed_seconds":N}` | Codex nonzero exit or missing result                                                  |
| `{"type":"handoff.failed","reason":"cancelled","elapsed_seconds":N}`    | Wrapper received INT/TERM                                                             |

The result JSON itself is in the path passed to `--result-file`, not in this progress file. Without `--result-file`, the
wrapper writes the result to stdout for backward compatibility. Token accounting is best-effort. When no value parses,
the wrapper omits `output_tokens`. `turn.completed` usage is the thread-cumulative total. Thus, a `--resume` run's count
includes every prior run of that thread.

That run's own usage is its sentinel total minus the prior run's sentinel total.

## Wave watcher

Use one bundled watcher per wave. Pass repeated agent ID, budget-seconds, and progress-file triples:

```sh
bash scripts/watch-codex-wave.sh \
  --agent A1 1200 /tmp/A1.progress.jsonl \
  --agent A2 2400 /tmp/A2.progress.jsonl
```

Its stdout is machine-readable JSONL. `watcher.digest` reports elapsed/budget, event count, last relevant activity, and
delayed-file state. `watcher.sentinel` preserves the wrapper sentinel and reason. `watcher.settlement` supplies exact
settled counts, percentage, and ten-cell bar. A completed wave exits `0`. Any failed agent sentinel settles normally and
makes the watcher exit `1` after all agents settle.

If an unsettled agent exceeds its budget plus a 120-second grace, the watcher synthesizes
`{"type":"handoff.failed","reason":"no-sentinel"}` and settles it as failed. The watcher ignores a wrapper sentinel
arriving after that settlement. This only backstops a dead wrapper. The wrapper remains the timeout authority. Malformed
or otherwise invalid progress emits `watcher.failed` and exits as an invariant failure, not an agent result.

`watcher.digest.lastActivity` is deliberately privacy-minimal. It carries only `type` for messages, reasoning, web
searches, todo lists, and item or stream errors. It carries `type` plus `status` for file changes. It carries `type`,
`command`, and `status` for command execution. It carries `type`, `server`, `tool`, and `status` for MCP calls. It
carries `type`, `tool`, and `status` for collaboration calls.

The watcher omits missing fields. Never include message or reasoning text, search queries, arguments, results, prompts,
thread IDs, agent states, or error messages. Neither a stream `error` nor an item `error` settles an agent. Only the
wrapper sentinel does.
