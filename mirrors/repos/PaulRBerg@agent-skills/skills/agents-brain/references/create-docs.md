# Create or Regenerate Context

Use these placement and generation rules within `maintain` when missing context is warranted or regeneration is
requested. Create README.md and AGENTS.md from repository evidence. Regenerate existing targets only with `--force` or
an equally explicit overwrite instruction. Create other context docs only on explicit request. Skill creation follows
`references/maintain-skills.md` from this skill.

Success means each selected package root has the requested human and agent context. CLAUDE.md handling matches the
installed Claude Code. See Claude Code Compatibility in SKILL.md. Generated claims pass repository-defined validation.

## Select Targets

Package roots are the repository root and directories containing one of these manifests:

- `package.json`
- `Cargo.toml`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `setup.py`
- `go.mod`
- `foundry.toml`
- `Gemfile`
- `composer.json`

Create README.md only at package roots. Create package-root AGENTS.md files there as well. Apply `path` and
`--root-only` before analyzing targets.

You may also create nested AGENTS.md files when both conditions hold:

- The user explicitly requests broad context creation.
- The subtree has a distinct command runner, generated-file boundary, ownership rule, deployment or data constraint,
  safety requirement, or review workflow.

Otherwise, report the recommendation without writing it. Never create README.md in an arbitrary leaf directory.

For each selected target, classify README.md, AGENTS.md, and CLAUDE.md as missing, reusable, safely replaceable, or
blocked. Maintain existing README.md and AGENTS.md with targeted edits under `references/maintain.md`. Regenerate them
only with overwrite authority. A request restricted to creating missing files leaves existing files untouched.

## Ground the Content

Derive claims from the nearest manifests and metadata, task runners, lock files, CI and lint configuration,
generated-file notices, and relevant source boundaries. Use a user-provided description when present. Verify any factual
claims it adds.

Do not invent project purpose, badges, links, commands, conventions, ownership, or safety rules. When evidence is
missing, narrow the generated document instead of guessing.

## Generate README.md

Keep README.md human-facing:

- Add a title and short factual description.
- Add only verified documentation, homepage, demo, package, changelog, citation, funding, reference, or license links
  that materially help readers.
- Add a short contributing pointer to sibling AGENTS.md.
- Include a short operator-run setup guide only for dotfiles, infrastructure, homelab, personal tooling, or an explicit
  setup request.

Do not add developer command inventories, directory trees, configuration manuals, contribution rules, marketing copy, or
placeholders.

## Generate AGENTS.md

Keep AGENTS.md concise, imperative, and scoped:

- Name the stack and preferred package manager only when useful for choosing commands.
- Include commands whose runner, order, side effects, environment, or failure behavior matters.
- Include non-obvious architecture, style, naming, generated-file, ownership, safety, external-disclosure, credential,
  deployment, financial, recipient-scoped data-handling, and review constraints supported by evidence.
- Exclude generic tool tutorials, long directory trees, and package-script inventories that add no preference or
  warning.
- Make AGENTS.md a map. Link deeper context docs instead of inlining them. Keep it short enough to load on every task.
- When the user requests continuous repo-local skill maintenance, include the standing instruction from this skill's
  `references/maintain-skills.md`, adapted to the repository's ownership and lifecycle rules.

Parent files hold shared defaults. Nested files contain only local deltas.

## Handle CLAUDE.md

Run the version check from Claude Code Compatibility in SKILL.md. When `agents_md_native=true`, create no CLAUDE.md
symlinks. In that case, delete any existing symlink to a sibling AGENTS.md in the selected tree. Otherwise, create a
sibling compatibility symlink for each created AGENTS.md:

```sh
(cd "$dir" && ln -sfn AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md)
```

Write only when CLAUDE.md is missing or already a symlink. A regular CLAUDE.md blocks only that symlink target. Leave it
untouched. Report the conflict.

## Create Context Docs on Request

Create a Markdown context doc outside the default set only when the user explicitly names its path and purpose. Examples
include a conventions file, command catalog, data-format reference, workflow runbook, architecture map, plan log, or
decision log. Ground its content in repository evidence like any other target. Keep it scoped to that purpose. When that
improves discoverability, link it from the nearest AGENTS.md or README.md.

Do not scan for missing context docs. At most, report a recommendation without writing it.

## Handle CONTRIBUTING.md

Never edit CONTRIBUTING.md. If it exists next to a target, put only stable, relevant contribution guidance in AGENTS.md.
In that case, advise the user to merge any remaining useful instructions manually before deleting CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Finish

Return to the shared completion checks and report contract in SKILL.md. In dry-run mode, show selected paths and concise
section-level previews or diffs. Keep all creation and regeneration within the selected maintenance scope.
