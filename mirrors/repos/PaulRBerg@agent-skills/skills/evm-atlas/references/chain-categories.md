# Chain categories and exact-zero native sweeps

`references/generated/target-mainnets.json` is the source of truth for every target's current `category`. Categories
describe current architecture, not historical protocol behavior. Do not duplicate a target-chain roster here: resolve
the row first, then report its category with the chain evidence.

| Category | Key        | Scope and exact-zero implication                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mainnet  | `mainnet`  | Ethereum only. A fixed-price plain native transfer is eligible when its current inclusion and standard-transfer proof holds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Alt L1   | `alt-l1`   | Ethereum-style L1s, deliberately including Polygon PoS. They can be eligible only with target-specific proof of fixed gas, a fixed full `gasPrice` debit, and no extra debits or credits; BNB Chain and Polygon PoS are examples.                                                                                                                  |
| L2 OP    | `op-stack` | Ineligible for a guaranteed direct exact-zero transfer: automatic uncapped L1 data fees and operator fees can add to execution gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Nitro    | `nitro`    | Ineligible for a guaranteed direct exact-zero transfer: parent-chain posting economics and CollectTips-dependent charged pricing prevent the required fixed total debit proof.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ZK       | `zk`       | Includes ZK Stack, validium, and hybrid targets. Linea and Taiko can be eligible when a standard fixed legacy debit is proven at inclusion. Scroll and Morph are ineligible because of separate dynamic L1 fees. ZK Stack targets, including ZKsync Era, Abstract, and Sophon, are ineligible because pubdata, overhead, and refunds are variable. |
| Alt L2   | `alt-l2`   | Fallback category. Treat as unknown: require bespoke target proof of the complete debit, or block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Category is only the first gate. An eligible category still requires current target-specific evidence that the
transaction is an ordinary empty-calldata transfer, uses a fixed full charge at inclusion, has no additional debit or
credit, and has a fixed gas use. Type-0 acceptance, a fixed bid shape, or successful simulation alone does not prove
eligibility.

For Ethereum-style accounting, an included legacy transaction pays its signed `gasPrice`: changes to base fees or
admission quotes can prevent inclusion, but do not reprice the signed transaction. Linea's L1-cost-based profitability
check is an admission rule, not an additional sender debit; Taiko also charges the signed legacy price without a
separate L1 fee. With proven `21000` gas, ordinary EOAs, empty calldata, and unchanged balance/nonce/code, both permit
`value = balance - 21000 * gasPrice`. This is conditional on inclusion, not a guarantee that a public transaction will
be included.

OP Stack means OP Stack-based execution, including forks: its L1 data fee and any enabled operator fee are added to
execution cost. Nitro means the Arbitrum family, including AnyTrust chains: its parent-chain posting charge is converted
into child-chain gas, not added again as a separate wei fee. Fixing the legacy bid does not fix either family's total
charge. ZK covers distinct execution and proving systems, so use the named chain's fee branch rather than inferring a
shared fee model from its proof technology.

Filecoin FEVM is an Alt L1 exception. FVM fee translation and overestimation require bespoke evidence; do not generalize
Ethereum-style L1 fee behavior to it. A fresh EOA recipient does not alter the standard top-level transfer gas cost: the
`25000` new-account `CALL` cost concerns the contract opcode, not a top-level transfer. Still exclude precompiles and
protocol system destinations; `eth_getCode == 0x` alone does not establish that an address is an ordinary recipient.

For a category-fee or exact-drain question, return the current category, target row, protocol/source evidence, and the
decision before any signer setup. Atlas remains read-only; return evidence for `$cli-cast` and the calling workflow to
construct, simulate, and account for a transaction.
