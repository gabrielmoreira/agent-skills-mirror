# Testing Patterns

> Match local naming, imports/globals, DOM utilities, fixtures, and cleanup.

- For components, drive accessible observable behavior: query by role or label, then visible text, with semantic test
  IDs last. Keep provider state fresh; centralize a wrapper only when several tests need it. Use jest-dom matchers only
  when the setup file imports them.
- Await or return every promise. Wrap callback APIs in a promise; a test callback parameter is Vitest context, not a
  completion callback. In v4, pass an options object as the second argument (a numeric final timeout remains supported).
- Put fixture cleanup with the fixture and scenario data with its test. Use tables only where cases clarify distinct
  behavior. Use snapshots only for stable, reviewable output; focused assertions are usually better.
- Do not commit `only`. Use skips, tags, or concurrency only with an explicit condition and safe isolation.
- Use browser mode and visual assertions only when the repository already owns browser configuration; do not add it
  merely for a component test covered by the established environment.
