# Pattern Matching

When tagged-union branching should be exhaustive, use `Match`. Also use it when a multi-case error handler would
otherwise become a chain of nested conditionals.

```ts
const renderError = Match.type<AppError>().pipe(
  Match.tag("ValidationError", (error) => error.message),
  Match.tag("NetworkError", () => "Connection failed"),
  Match.exhaustive,
);
```

Use `Match.value` for one local value and `Match.type` when defining a reusable matcher. When every variant must be
handled, prefer `Match.exhaustive`. Use `Match.orElse` only when the fallback is a real domain case. For a plain object
of per-tag handlers, `Match.valueTags` and `Match.typeTags` are exhaustive shorthands. `Match.either` is now
`Match.result`.

For a `Data.taggedEnum`, prefer its `$match` helper when generic variant payloads or recursive unions would otherwise
require assertions. Verify constructor and matcher signatures against the installed `Data` source before changing a
generic union.
