**Evidence / expected proof for implementation**

For UI or user-facing features, attach current-state screenshots or a short recording
that shows the workflow today. The implementing PR must include:

- [ ] Before and after full-page screenshots for affected UI surfaces (desktop and mobile).
- [ ] A video walkthrough of the full flow.
- [ ] Backend logs and frontend console/network logs when a real code path is involved.
- [ ] Real-LLM trajectory when the feature changes agent/action/prompt/model behavior.
- [ ] Domain artifacts when relevant (DB rows, memories, scheduled tasks, generated files, wallet/on-chain output).

Store durable artifacts under
`.github/issue-evidence/<issue#>-<slug>.<ext>`. If an item is unavailable, keep
the row visible and write `N/A - <reason>`.
