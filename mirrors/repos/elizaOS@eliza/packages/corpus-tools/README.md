# @elizaos/corpus-tools

Private personal-corpus interchange schema, validators, and archive collectors
for #14747. The package normalizes source exports into `CorpusMessage` JSONL
shards and validates manifest integrity.

Raw and intermediate owner data belongs under `packages/corpus-tools/data/`,
which is ignored by the repo-wide `**/data/` rule. Only synthetic fixtures
under `fixtures/` are committed.

## X archive collector

`collectXArchive` (`src/collectors/x-archive.ts`) parses the official X data
archive — either the downloaded ZIP or an extracted directory — and writes
validated monthly shards plus `manifest.json` and `x-archive-summary.json`:

```ts
import { collectXArchive } from "@elizaos/corpus-tools";

const result = await collectXArchive({
  archivePath: "data/raw/x/archive.zip",
  ownerAccountId: "<numeric X account id>",
  ownerDisplay: "Owner Name",
  outDir: "data",
});
```

Tweets map to direction `out` with the thread id resolved to the reply-chain
root; DMs map per conversation with direction derived from the sender versus
the owner id; rows before the corpus cutoff (`2024-07-05`) are dropped. Likes
carry no timestamps in the archive, so they are counted in the summary and
never emitted as message rows. Re-running is idempotent: unchanged shards are
reused, missing shards are rewritten.

## Loader for mock and scenario consumers

`loadCorpusMessages` (`src/loader.ts`) is the read boundary for downstream
mocks: it validates a shard tree with the shared validator, applies a
platform/account/thread/window/cap selection with deterministic ts-then-id
ordering, and enforces a scrub floor that defaults to `verified` — unscrubbed
rows never reach a consumer unless a test explicitly loosens
`minScrubState`. Any validation issue aborts the load (`CorpusLoadError`)
rather than serving a partial corpus, and an unrecognized `minScrubState` or a
malformed numeric bound is rejected as a `CorpusSelectionError` at the call
boundary; the array selection fields must be arrays, so a decoded-config
string cannot widen an account filter into a substring match. Message-id
uniqueness and reply resolution are evaluated over the whole collected corpus,
not per shard, and because selection can still cut a thread, a released row
whose parent was not released is emitted with `replyToId` dropped. The
committed synthetic tree under
`fixtures/sample-corpus/` exercises the whole path in CI; the scenario-runner
Gmail mock consumes this loader via `ELIZA_CORPUS_DIR` /
`startMocks({ corpusDir })` (see
`packages/scenario-runner/test/mocks/scripts/google-gmail-corpus.ts`).
## Gmail collector

`collectGmail` (`src/collectors/gmail.ts`) collects one Gmail account into
validated monthly shards through an injected `GmailTransport`. The package
never holds OAuth material: a live run wraps the existing account-scoped
plugin-google Gmail client (`gmail.read` scope) in a small adapter that
implements `getProfile`, `listMessageIds`, `getMessage` (`format: "full"`),
`getAttachment`, and `listHistory`, translating HTTP failures into
`GmailTransportError` with the upstream status and any `Retry-After` hint.

The adapter must pass Gmail responses through unprojected. In particular
`listHistory` has to forward `messagesAdded`, `messagesDeleted`,
`labelsAdded`, `labelsRemoved`, `nextPageToken`, and the page's terminal
`historyId`: labels decide both inclusion (`DRAFT`/`CHAT`) and direction
(`SENT`), so an adapter that returns only add/delete events leaves stale
verdicts frozen in the corpus. `getMessage` must surface a deleted message as
`GmailTransportError` with status 404 rather than an empty object.

```ts
import { collectGmail, type GmailTransport } from "@elizaos/corpus-tools";

const result = await collectGmail({
  transport: makePluginGoogleTransport(accountRef), // owner-side adapter
  accountEmail: "owner@example.com",
  aliasEmails: ["owner.alias@example.com"],
  outDir: "data",
});
```

Behavior contract:

- The query is the frozen UTC corpus window expressed in epoch seconds
  (Gmail's `after:yyyy/mm/dd` is local-timezone and would shift the cutoff);
  chats are excluded and drafts are dropped by label.
- Pagination runs to exhaustion with a durable checkpoint per page under
  `data/.state/gmail-<account>.json`; fetched rows append to a private
  staging JSONL so an interrupted run resumes without refetching.
- A completed checkpoint is never trusted indefinitely: the next run
  reconciles through `users.history.list` from the checkpointed history id,
  applying additions, deletions, and label changes; a relabeled id drops its
  cached exclusion/staging verdict and is refetched, so a draft that becomes
  real mail enters the corpus and a message relabeled `CHAT` leaves it. The
  checkpoint then advances to the terminal `historyId` of the pages actually
  applied (never backwards), not to the pre-reconciliation profile snapshot.
  An expired/invalid history id (HTTP 404/400) triggers a full rescan.
- A message deleted between `messages.list` and `messages.get` (HTTP 404) is
  recorded as a deletion in `missingAtFetch` and excluded, not treated as a
  fatal transport failure.
- 429/5xx transport failures retry with bounded exponential backoff,
  honoring the server retry hint.
- Ids are account-namespaced (`gmail:<account>:<messageId>`); direction is
  alias-aware (`From` versus the account plus `aliasEmails`) or `SENT`
  label; text prefers `text/plain` and falls back to stripped `text/html`;
  attachment bytes are fetched only to compute SHA-256 and size, and
  attachment-only messages are counted, never given fabricated text — the
  empty-text verdict is reached before the attachment fetch, so a dropped
  message spends no quota and `attachmentsHashed` counts only attachments that
  reached the corpus.
- Shards no longer named by a run are swept, but a run that emitted **no**
  messages refuses to sweep and fails with
  `GMAIL_COLLECT_EMPTY_SWEEP_REFUSED`. An expired history id forces a full
  rescan, and a transiently empty listing on that path would otherwise unlink
  the only local copy of the owner's mail. Pass `allowEmptySweep: true` to
  delete once the empty result has been confirmed.
- Output is private (0600 files, 0700 directories) and account-isolated under
  `gmail/<segment>/`, where `<segment>` is the sanitized, collision-free
  account segment (`corpusAccountSegment`) rather than the raw address, so an
  address can never steer writes or the stale-shard sweep outside `outDir`.
  Shards are byte-stable on rerun and committed by a validated
  `manifest.json`.
- Concurrency is serialized by a per-account lease file recording PID,
  hostname and process start time. A live owner fails the second run closed
  with `GMAIL_COLLECT_OUTPUT_BUSY`; a lease abandoned by SIGKILL/OOM is
  detected as dead and recovered on the next run, so crash resume never needs
  manual filesystem repair. Recovery displaces the dead record with an atomic
  `rename` rather than an unlink, so two runs racing to recover the same
  abandoned lease cannot both end up holding the account.

Live-run acceptance evidence (two owner-authorized accounts, refresh-token
exercise, interruption/resume, quota behavior, manual shard inspection) is
owner-only and stays local; share only sanitized aggregate counts and digests.

## Reviewed sensitive deletion

The two-phase deletion boundary never mutates raw source shards. `plan` binds a
strict JSON/YAML ruleset and candidate inventory to a deterministic local review
queue; `apply` requires a complete decision document for that exact queue and
writes a separate survivor corpus, zero-content tombstones, manifest, ledger,
approval, and sanitized report.

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/corpus-tools validate -- data/source
bun run --cwd packages/corpus-tools corpus:delete -- plan \
  --target data/source --candidates data/.state/candidates.jsonl \
  --rules data/delete-rules.yaml --queue data/.state/deletion-review.json \
  --normalized-rules data/.state/deletion-rules.normalized.json
bun run --cwd packages/corpus-tools corpus:delete -- apply \
  --target data/source --candidates data/.state/candidates.jsonl \
  --normalized-rules data/.state/deletion-rules.normalized.json \
  --queue data/.state/deletion-review.json \
  --decisions data/.state/deletion-decisions.json --output data/deleted \
  --ledger data/.state/deletion-ledger.jsonl \
  --manifest data/deleted/manifest.json \
  --approval data/.state/deletion-approval.json \
  --report data/.state/deletion-report.json
```

Rules and decisions are private owner inputs. Review every atomic group before
apply, retain only counts and hashes in shared evidence, and prove idempotent
re-apply plus stale-decision rejection against a protected snapshot before the
issue is closed.

## Telegram Desktop collector

`collectTelegramDesktopExport` parses the machine-readable `result.json`
created by Telegram Desktop's Settings → Advanced → Export Telegram data flow.
It is offline-only: the collector does not accept GramJS clients,
`StringSession` values, Telegram API credentials, or raw `tdata` directories.

```ts
import { collectTelegramDesktopExport } from "@elizaos/corpus-tools";

const result = await collectTelegramDesktopExport({
  exportPath: "data/raw/telegram/result.json",
  ownerAccountId: "<numeric Telegram user id>",
  outDir: "data",
  allowedGroupPeerIds: ["<explicitly selected group id>"],
  allowedChannelPeerIds: ["<explicitly selected channel id>"],
});
```

DMs are admitted by default; groups and channels are denied unless their bare
peer ids are allowlisted. Rows are bounded to the canonical corpus
cutoff/anchor, identities include account + peer kind + peer id + message id,
and monthly shards plus the manifest and aggregate summary are byte-stable on
rerun. Service, deleted, secret-chat, and media-only records are counted but
not fabricated into text messages. Export media paths are never opened, so
metadata alone never produces an attachment SHA-256.

Telegram's `verification_codes` dialog is always excluded and counted as
credential material. Input is capped at 64 MiB and read only through that byte
boundary before parsing. Symlinked or hardlinked inputs, duplicate JSON object
keys, and files changed during capture are rejected. Publications use an
output-root lock, account-owned
`telegram/<account>/summary.json` files, and a manifest installed last as the
generation commit marker. Before the first changed or stale shard is installed,
an existing marker is removed so an interrupted update is visibly incomplete;
unchanged reruns retain it byte-for-byte. Collector-owned hardlinks, concurrent
writers, and manifest validation issues fail the collection instead of
returning partial success.

Migrated basic-group history retains Telegram Desktop's signed negative message
and reply ids; account and peer identities remain positive-only. Collection
currently fails closed on Windows because Node's portable filesystem API cannot
both reject directory reparse points and establish owner-only ACLs for these raw
private-message artifacts. Windows support requires platform-specific ACL and
reparse-point enforcement plus real-host verification.

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/corpus-tools test
bun run --cwd packages/corpus-tools typecheck
```
