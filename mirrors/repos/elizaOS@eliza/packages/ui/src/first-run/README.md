# First-Run Setup

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `use-first-run-conductor.ts` | Headless in-chat conductor that seeds first-run chat turns and routes `__first_run__:` choices. |
| `first-run-finish.ts` | Single headless finish use case: runtime startup, cloud/remote binding, and exactly-once `/api/first-run` persistence. |
| `first-run.ts` | Deterministic first-run state helpers and submit payload builder. |
| `setup-steps.ts` | Internal setup cursor for state-side completion callbacks. |
| `reload-into-first-run-runtime.ts` | Runtime-switch URL and storage reset helper used by Settings. |
| `deep-link-handler.ts` | Mobile deep-link adapter for selecting first-run runtime targets. |
| `runtime-target.ts` | Persisted runtime identity (local / remote / elizacloud / elizacloud-hybrid) used across the shell and mobile runtime. |
| `mobile-runtime-mode.ts` | Mobile-specific runtime mode persistence tied to the server target. |

## The onboarding lock

While first-run is pending the floating chat is a modal onboarding surface:
pinned FULL, composer locked ("Choose an option to continue"), every collapse
path a no-op, and a one-shot auto-collapse on completion. The full contract (and
which seam enforces each guarantee) is documented in
[`IN_CHAT_ONBOARDING_DESIGN.md`](./IN_CHAT_ONBOARDING_DESIGN.md) and covered by
`../components/shell/ContinuousChatOverlay.firstrun.test.tsx`.
