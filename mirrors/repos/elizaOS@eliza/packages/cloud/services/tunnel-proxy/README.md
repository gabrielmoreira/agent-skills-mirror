# tunnel-proxy

Railway service for public Eliza Cloud tunnel URLs.

The service joins the Headscale tailnet with `tsnet` as `tag:eliza-proxy`.
Railway terminates public TLS for `tunnel.eliza.app` and
`*.tunnel.eliza.app`, then this proxy maps
the public host to the matching Headscale MagicDNS host:

```text
eliza-<org>-<random>.tunnel.eliza.app -> https://eliza-<org>-<random>.tunnel.eliza.local
```

Only Cloud-minted hostnames matching
`eliza-<orgpart>-<randomhex>-<expiry>-<signature>` are proxied when
`TUNNEL_HOSTNAME_SIGNING_SECRET` is set. Root traffic and arbitrary wildcard
labels return 404, while `/health` and `/ready` remain public for Railway and
DNS smoke checks.

Required Railway environment variables:

| Variable                         | Value                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HEADSCALE_PUBLIC_URL`           | `https://headscale.eliza.app`                           |
| `TUNNEL_PROXY_TS_AUTHKEY`        | reusable Headscale preauth key tagged `tag:eliza-proxy` |
| `TUNNEL_PROXY_HOST`              | `tunnel.eliza.app`                                      |
| `TUNNEL_TAILNET_DOMAIN`          | `tunnel.eliza.local`                                    |
| `TUNNEL_HOSTNAME_SIGNING_SECRET` | shared HMAC secret also set as a Cloud Worker secret    |

Mount a Railway volume at `/var/lib/tunnel-proxy` so the `tsnet` node identity
persists across restarts.

## Protected deployment

Use `.github/workflows/deploy-tunnel-proxy.yml` for staging or production. The
selected GitHub Environment must define these variables:

- `HEADSCALE_PUBLIC_URL` — exactly `https://headscale-staging.eliza.app` or
  `https://headscale.eliza.app`;
- `TUNNEL_PROXY_HOST` — exactly `tunnel-staging.eliza.app` or
  `tunnel.eliza.app`;
- `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`, `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, and
  `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID_TUNNEL_PROXY` — the existing Railway `tunnel-proxy`
  target.

It must also define `RAILWAY_TOKEN`, `ELIZA_PROVISIONING_HOST`,
`ELIZA_PROVISIONING_SSH_KEY`, `ELIZA_PROVISIONING_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`, and
`TUNNEL_HOSTNAME_SIGNING_SECRET` as secrets. The known-hosts value must contain
the independently verified SSH host key for `ELIZA_PROVISIONING_HOST`; the
workflow does not trust a key learned during the deploy. The Railway project
token must be scoped to the selected project/environment. The signing secret
must be the same environment-owned value published to the Cloud Worker by
`cloud-cf-deploy.yml`.

The workflow creates or verifies the `/var/lib/tunnel-proxy` volume and waits
for Railway's eventually consistent service attachment before it mints a
replacement reusable `tag:eliza-proxy` Headscale preauth key over SSH. It sends
both sensitive Railway values through CLI stdin, uploads this directory, and
converges the exact apex and wildcard Railway custom domains. It expires prior
matching reusable keys only after the canonical `/health` endpoint returns
`{"status":"pass"}` and an arbitrary unsigned wildcard hostname returns 404.

Railway domain attachment and Cloudflare DNS are separate credential
boundaries. The workflow can attach the exact custom domains but never receives
a Cloudflare token. When Railway reports an unverified domain, copy its exact
CNAME/TXT requirements into the protected
`RAILWAY_TUNNEL_DNS_RECORDS_JSON` inventory, add any existing Cloudflare ids to
`DNS_RECORD_IMPORT_IDS_JSON` under `railway-tunnel/<logical-key>`, and dispatch
the protected `Infrastructure` workflow for `pages-domains`. Rerun this deploy
only after the reviewed Terraform plan is applied. The Terraform records stay
DNS-only so Railway terminates wildcard TLS without a paid Cloudflare advanced
certificate.
