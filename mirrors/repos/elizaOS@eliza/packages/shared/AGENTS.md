# @elizaos/shared

Shared contracts, configuration, utilities, and assets used by runtime hosts,
UI, Cloud services, and plugins. Repository rules in the
[root guide](../../CLAUDE.md) apply.

## Ownership and entry points

This package depends on core and registry. Keep host assembly in agent/app-core,
view rendering in UI, and provider integration in its plugin. Importing an
application host here can introduce a boot-time dependency cycle.

The root [barrel](src/index.ts) includes Node-specific Cloud TTS helpers through
`src/elizacloud/index.ts`. It is not an environment-neutral leaf. Browser
consumers must use appropriate subpaths or their host's explicit bundler
configuration. Keep React hooks out of the root so server consumers do not
initialize React UI state.

Check [package.json](package.json) before changing an export. Preserve published
compatibility deliberately: search consumers, generated templates, and compiled
declarations. Subpaths such as brand, local-inference persistence, and Steward
session helpers express real runtime boundaries and should not be collapsed
into the root solely for import uniformity.

## Source map

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/api/`, `src/contracts/` | Cross-package request, response, and domain contracts |
| `src/config/` | Configuration types, validation, environment aliases, and boot state |
| `src/local-inference/` | Model catalog and policies; separate filesystem verification/persistence modules |
| `src/elizacloud/` | Cloud URL, provisioning, and server TTS helpers |
| `src/steward-session-client/` | Browser session synchronization and credential clearing |
| `src/apps/` | App detail/overlay extension registration contracts |
| `src/brand/`, `assets/` | Shared tokens and source brand assets |
| `src/i18n/` | Application locale normalization over the canonical prompt keyword matcher |
| `src/utils/` | Utilities shared by multiple consumers |

## Changes and validation

- Add API contracts to their domain module and export through the relevant
  barrel. Keep protocol values and domain computation in their owning layer.
- Add configuration fields to the owning `types.*.ts` module and update the
  corresponding validation schema. Preserve the established environment alias
  precedence rather than introducing direct reads at new call sites.
- Keep browser-compatible metadata separate from Node filesystem operations.
  `src/local-inference/index.ts` exports verification types; actual verification
  and routing persistence have dedicated subpaths.
- Edit authored keyword data in [prompts](../prompts/src/keywords.ts); shared
  locale wrappers use `@elizaos/prompts/keyword-matching`. Edit brand assets
  and run `sync` to copy them into consumer public directories.
- Synthetic environment and subprocess namespaces share
  `isSyntheticEnvironmentNamespace`: 1–512 non-control characters, without
  silently trimming caller input.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/shared build
bun run --cwd packages/shared typecheck
bun run --cwd packages/shared lint:check
bun run --cwd packages/shared test
```

`build` delegates to `build:dist` to emit the publishable ESM distribution.
Neither build nor typecheck generates keyword source. Validate changed contracts through
actual consuming packages as well as focused unit tests. Root verification,
guide parity, and contribution evidence requirements remain applicable.


Markdown parsing, bounded frontmatter and platform rendering live in
`src/markdown/`, exported as `@elizaos/shared/markdown`. This leaf uses common
errors and parser dependencies, and must bundle for browsers without importing
the runtime or Cloud helpers. Keep its parser/Unicode/chunk tests with it.

Node media and connector attachment helpers live in `src/media/`, exported as
`@elizaos/shared/media`. Keep the leaf independent of the shared root barrel
and Cloud helpers. It uses core network guards and file-type byte detection.
