# @elizaos/capacitor-secure-store

Device-only Apple Keychain and Android Keystore storage for Eliza app credentials.

Install workspace dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root.

Build from the repository root:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-secure-store build
```

Native storage behavior requires testing on the target Apple or Android device.

Android's device suite verifies the real WebView/Capacitor/Keystore round trip,
activity recreation, ciphertext persistence, deletion, and invalid/corrupt input:

```bash
node packages/app/scripts/android-native-plugins.ts --serial emulator-5554 --plugin plugin-native-secure-store
```

Android bridge instances serialize Keystore key creation and AtomicFile operations
within one process. Recovery includes backup-only values; removal checks base,
backup and pending writes. The existing ciphertext format and account binding
remain compatible. Keystore availability does not assert StrongBox protection.
Device tests use synthetic credentials in an isolated UID and cover complete
262,144-byte values, backup recovery, corruption and concurrent cold key creation.
Inspect the terminal instrumentation result, not only the shell exit status.
