# @elizaos/plugin-native-contacts

Android address-book overlay app for elizaOS: provides a full-screen UI surface for
browsing, searching, creating, and importing contacts, plus a read-only dynamic provider
that injects address-book context into the agent planner.

See [bridge definitions](src/definitions.ts) for the native API. Native targets require their SDKs, registered bridge, and OS permissions.

## Development

Install dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root. Run from that root:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-contacts build  # build
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-contacts test   # tests
```

Native view and app-shell declarations share an ADMIN-gated capability catalog. Agents use named complete-or-error reads; mutations and generic renderer/DOM operations require human interaction. A bridge result at its non-paginated boundary is an explicit incomplete-read error. Device-status failures remain errors rather than fabricated empty state.

Explicit limits must be positive safe integers; omitted reads are complete.
Malformed limits reject with INVALID_LIMIT. Missing provider cursors reject with
CONTACTS_UNAVAILABLE; valid empty cursors remain empty arrays. The isolated
ContactsBridgeInstrumentedTest exercises create/read/search and numeric limits
against actual ContactsProvider; null/empty child-query failures inject only the
provider response into the production reader. Cleanup owns exact synthetic raw
contact IDs. Inspect terminal instrumentation results, not just shell exit status.
