# @elizaos/plugin-doordash

DoorDash consumer-ordering capabilities for Eliza agents through a configured
MCP adapter. The agent gets one stable `DOORDASH` action even when the backing
server uses a different tool vocabulary.

Eliza app turns prefer the app's built-in `BROWSER` workspace so authentication
and browsing stay visible on the user's phone or computer. Turns from iMessage
and other connectors without that workspace use the isolated Cloudflare Browser
Run session behind `DOORDASH`. If an app turn cannot resolve its workspace
target, it safely falls back to Cloudflare.

## Capabilities

- Check authentication status
- Set a delivery address or clear the adapter session when supported
- Search restaurants and cuisines
- Browse menus
- Add or remove cart items
- Inspect active carts and order history
- Preview checkout
- Place an explicitly confirmed order
- Track an order

The plugin recognizes both reviewed community adapters:

- [`markswendsen-code/mcp-doordash`](https://github.com/markswendsen-code/mcp-doordash)
- [`SpunkySarb/doordash-mcp`](https://github.com/SpunkySarb/doordash-mcp)

See [ADAPTER_REVIEW.md](./ADAPTER_REVIEW.md) for the pinned-source comparison,
security findings, integration decision, and Cloud acceptance checklist.

It does not embed either community adapter. Eliza Cloud uses Cloudflare Browser
Run with outbound-domain guardrails; self-hosted agents can configure either
reviewed adapter. All browser-based consumer automation can break when DoorDash
changes and may be incompatible with DoorDash's terms.

## Configure a local adapter

Install `@elizaos/plugin-mcp` and this plugin, then add a server named
`doordash` to character settings. For example, after installing the packaged
Strider adapter:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-mcp", "@elizaos/plugin-doordash"],
  "settings": {
    "mcp": {
      "servers": {
        "doordash": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@striderlabs/mcp-doordash"],
          "timeoutInMillis": 120000
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "features": {
    "doordash": true
  }
}
```

For a remote adapter, keep its URL out of character data:

```bash
MCP_SERVER_DOORDASH_URL=https://adapter.example.com/mcp
MCP_SERVER_DOORDASH_TYPE=streamable-http
```

Eliza Cloud exposes the same authenticated transport at
`/api/mcps/doordash/streamable-http`. The Worker's `BROWSER` binding creates a
short-lived Browser Run session bound to the exact Cloud user and conversation,
and returns a Cloudflare Live View through `status`. Installed desktop and mobile apps open
that URL with `/browser?browse=...`, which uses the app's isolated native
Browser surface. DoorDash credentials and cookies remain inside Browser Run.
An operator can instead set
`MCP_DOORDASH_STREAMABLE_HTTP_URL` to use a reviewed external implementation.

## Checkout safety

`place_order` does not trust a model-generated boolean. It reads the current
cart and a fresh checkout preview, computes a SHA-256 digest over both, and asks
the user to confirm that exact state. The managed browser receives that same
digest, re-reads the cart and checkout immediately before the order click, and
fails closed if an item, quantity, total, address, or ETA changed. The adapter
must return a real DoorDash order ID; missing and timestamp-generated fallback
IDs are rejected as unverified.

Community adapters may not meet this contract. Search, menus, carts, and history
can still work while checkout fails closed.

## Cloud managed adapter

The first-party Cloud path:

- authenticates every MCP request and isolates hosted sessions per Eliza user and conversation;
- returns a Cloudflare Live View plus an in-app Browser path without accepting credentials;
- restricts new browser sessions to DoorDash, supported identity/payment domains,
  and Cloudflare's common-CDN set;
- never returns or persists browser cookies through MCP;
- makes `confirm=false` non-purchasing and guards a confirmed checkout state
  against duplicate submission;
- rejects a missing or ambiguous provider order ID;
- supports confirmed session revocation through `clear_session`.

Neither reviewed community repository currently satisfies this multi-user
Cloud contract by itself.
