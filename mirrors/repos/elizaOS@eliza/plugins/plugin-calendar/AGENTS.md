# @elizaos/plugin-calendar

First-class calendar plugin for elizaOS agents. See `README.md` for the surface
overview and `../../CLAUDE.md` (repo root) for monorepo-wide rules.

## Role

Owns the calendar domain extracted from `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant`: the calendar
event/sync store + schema, the Google + Apple calendar feed, event CRUD, the
`CALENDAR` action and its LLM handler, the shared calendar route dispatcher,
the provider-authenticated Google webhook, the client API methods augmented
onto `@elizaos/ui`, and the owner-facing calendar views. Private
`/api/lifeops/calendar/*` routes are mounted by the personal-assistant host
behind its OWNER/ADMIN role gate.

## Boundary rules

- **Storage + provider logic live here.** The cross-connector **grant registry**
  (Google account selection, scopes, multi-account) stays in `plugin-personal-assistant`,
  which injects a `CalendarConnectorGate` into `CalendarService` at init. Never
  import `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant` from this package — the dependency direction
  is `plugin-personal-assistant -> plugin-calendar`.
- **Schema namespace is `app_calendar`.** Calendar events and sync states were
  carved out of PA's `app_lifeops` schema; ICS sources, the durable secret
  cleanup outbox, feed preferences, and Google watch channels are
  calendar-native tables. `calendarPgSchema = pgSchema("app_calendar")` is
  registered via the plugin `schema` field, and `CalendarMigrationService`
  performs a non-destructive one-time reconciliation of existing `app_lifeops`
  rows only into empty owner tables without completed migration claims. Fresh
  imports verify the full projection; established owner rows and deletions remain
  authoritative, and legacy sources are never dropped. Requires
  `@elizaos/plugin-sql` loaded first. Raw SQL
  must qualify table names with the `app_calendar.` prefix.
- **Contract types live in `@elizaos/shared/contracts/calendar`** so `@elizaos/ui`
  (which types its `client` against them) and the plugins can both depend on them
  without a cycle.
- **Logger only, never `console`.** Prefix with `[ClassName]`.

## Commands

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-calendar build
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-calendar build:types
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-calendar test
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-calendar typecheck
```

## Google push configuration

- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_ENABLED` must be exactly `true` before the public
  callback or watch creation is active; omission is fail-closed.
- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL` must be a public HTTPS URL with the exact
  `/api/lifeops/calendar/google/webhook` path.

## Verification

Follow the repository-wide verification and evidence standard in the [root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Run
the package's relevant build, typecheck, lint, and test commands, then exercise
the real integration boundary changed by the work. Inspect the produced domain
artifacts and failure behavior; do not substitute mocked success for the system
under test.

Calendar feed and event-search promoted tools use operation-specific details schemas authored in the calendar leaf module. Preserve all consumed range, timezone, calendar/connector selection, refresh and search-query aliases, plus original optionality and owner gates. Parent, trip and mutation schemas retain their full contracts; never narrow them by applying a read-only schema globally.

Typed search_events calls need an event-content query through any supported query alias. Missing or placeholder-only filters return CALENDAR_SEARCH_QUERY_REQUIRED before inference or reading; the planner can supply the filter or select feed for an unfiltered date range. The umbrella natural-language planner keeps its query-extraction fallback. Preserve complete history for legacy inference and complete feed/receipt data.

Explicit read-window bounds without an offset are civil times in the requested or configured timezone, including DST day lengths. Offset-bearing bounds preserve their exact instants in both typed and extracted plans; never reinterpret UTC midnight as local midnight. The action and service share the calendar datetime normalizer, and malformed planner windows remain invalid as a pair.

CALENDAR_SEARCH_QUERY_REQUIRED from typed preflight carries the core coachingFailure marker because no read or effect occurred. Preserve its failed receipt and required evaluation; a corrected successful feed may complete without forcing a stale-failure summary. Service outages, permission errors and mutation failures must not receive this marker.

Calendar read-window schema guidance treats timeMax as exclusive: a full civil day/month ends at the next day/month boundary in the requested timezone. The executor preserves model-selected bounds; it does not infer or silently rewrite the requested period from user prose.

Promoted Calendar read schemas describe read scope only: connector mode and side match the executor's accepted enums, and hidden-calendar guidance states each operation's actual default. Omitted connector filters stay omitted. Preserve consumed aliases, exact user-requested scopes and full parent/mutation schemas; do not infer scope from user prose or silently broaden a feed.

Conversational event creation re-derives timing from the authoritative user request and relevant dialogue, even when native planner arguments are syntactically complete. Missing extracted timing pauses before mutation and must not fall back to planner timestamps or window guesses. Availability alone does not authorize a schedule; choose a slot only when the user delegates that choice within a stated window. UI/API callers retain their structured request contract. Completion facts format relative days from the actual event and the same local timezone.

Conversational creates and time changes run the canonical availability evaluator against the exact proposed interval before writing. A move excludes only its own event ID. Conflicts pause without silently moving either event; incomplete calendar coverage cannot claim a free slot. This covers the owner feed, not unconsented guest availability or a transactional lock across external calendar providers.

Calendar mutation replies use the normal model response path with canonical effect receipts and full saved event evidence. A mechanically checked fact sentence is internal evidence, never a verbatim user-facing shortcut. Keep date/time facts exact while allowing concise conversational wording.

Update extraction requests local civil timestamps in the event timezone and anchors relative dates to the message timestamp. An extracted start uses only its paired extracted end, or the stored duration; do not mix that range with planner timing. Explicit extraction clarification pauses before mutation. Missing extracted timing preserves the stored timing; conversational updates never revive planner timestamps or timezone guesses. Empty extraction must pause without writing. Structured UI/API updates retain their separate service contract.

Blocked, definitive calendar writes may read the remaining local day and return two verified alternatives of the requested duration. Suggestions never authorize a write; accepted slots go through the normal write-time availability check. Free and inconclusive writes do not pay for this alternative lookup. Built-in calendar feed timestamps represent completed local reads, including empty windows; mutation replay remains ledger-owned.

Conversational update title, description and location come from request-grounded extraction, never unchecked planner optional fields. Omitted extracted fields preserve saved values; conflicting replacement/clear evidence pauses the write. Calendar extraction reuses the validated action-local dialogue selection when supplied and otherwise retains the complete provider history. Missing update-target preflight is coaching only before any read or write; preserve its failed receipt while allowing a corrected call to finish.

Conversational updates with no resolved editable field return clarification and a no-op receipt before any mutation. Existing event timezone defaults are not a requested field change. Conditional availability requests still extract the proposed interval; the canonical write-time availability check independently decides whether it may be committed.

Calendar create/update field extraction explicitly requests temperature zero through both standalone and host model runners. Other model calls retain their existing sampling defaults. Empty extraction still cannot authorize an empty write; missing timing and write-time conflict checks remain mandatory.

Calendar clarification results translate requiresInput into the canonical awaitingUserInput marker at the action adapter. Preserve failure/no-op receipts and grounded reply facts; a user-input pause must not become another attempt to perform the unresolved mutation.

Create and update extraction use native response schemas with required nullable fields. Create includes only its consumed scheduling fields and the requiresInput/clarification contract; unknown timing stays null and cannot fall back to planner guesses or a window preset. Conversational creation requires a concrete extracted start, including when the user delegates choosing a free slot. A clarification flag pauses before mutation even if contradictory timing fields are present. Structured service callers retain their preset contract. Update also includes an explicit requiresInput flag and explicit clearFields. Null means unchanged/unknown, never clear. The host and standalone runners preserve the schema through the existing TEXT_LARGE adapter. Semantic write authorization, ambiguity and conflict checks remain in the handler.

Calendar model runners must preserve both bare-string and native `{ text, ... }` model results. Passing responseSchema can select native result envelopes; discarding their text turns valid extracted changes into empty updates. Host wiring must forward the entire model-call contract.

Write-availability evidence includes localTimes derived from the same conflict and alternative instants in the requested IANA timezone. Replies use these labeled local values; original UTC ranges, privacy-filtered conflict details and effect receipts remain intact. Formatting never changes availability or authorizes a suggested slot.

The shared buildWideLookupRange and resolveCalendarMutationCandidates helpers also support owner-authorized rescheduling proposals in the personal-assistant host. Keep source-event identity separate from the destination window; proposal lookup cannot mutate the selected event or silently choose among duplicate targets.

Promoted update/delete target selectors are explicit: targetKind=query resolves the supplied title/source constraints; targetKind=eventId binds an exact result ID. A conflicting details.eventId is rejected before lookup or mutation with CALENDAR_TARGET_SELECTOR_INVALID and rejected acceptance. Legacy callers retain their existing selectors. Never silently drop a conflicting ID and mutate a title-matched replacement. Creation extraction, stated-day correction and mutation reply facts use the message timestamp for relative dates; processing later must not shift the requested weekday.

Typed Calendar searches derive their read window from explicit date/timestamp/window arguments, not unrelated dates in the complete multi-operation message. Legacy untyped natural-language reads retain inference. Preserve and report the actual read bounds.

Conversational attendee display names or mailbox names are not evidence of an email address. An explicit address in authoritative user text can be retained; a named guest with only a model-proposed address pauses creation with CALENDAR_ATTENDEE_IDENTITY_REQUIRED. Do not silently create an attendee-free event for that unresolved guest. Every proposed guest without explicit address evidence, including an apparently unrelated model-invented guest, pauses before any write. Malformed attendees cannot be silently discarded. This pause has rejected acceptance and awaits user input. Contact resolution must supply independently grounded address evidence before it can bypass clarification.

Conversational guest/recurrence evidence may reuse the runtime-selected original user messages from selectedActionConversation. Accept only prior-dialogue user segments matching the current room and requester; assistant recaps, other speakers/rooms and malformed optional evidence cannot establish authority. Append the current message last so explicit cadence corrections win. This supplies source evidence, not a new semantic permission verdict: planner/extractor and final receipt evaluation still resolve the requested event and current edits. Unselected/raw recent-message prose is not an authorization fallback.
