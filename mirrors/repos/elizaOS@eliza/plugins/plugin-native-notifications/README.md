# Notification mirror (Android)

An opt-in mirror of other apps' active notifications for an Eliza phone host. Android grants
notification-listener access; the owner separately enables the mirror, chooses at most 20
launcher apps (each pinned to its signing certificate), chooses per app whether previews are
shown, and may opt into a 24-hour history of post/remove events encrypted with an Android
Keystore AES-GCM key. Notification text, PendingIntents and foreign notification keys are never
persisted, and this module forwards nothing off the device or to an agent.

## Host integration

Include `android/` as a library module. Create one `NotificationMirror` for the process with an
immutable `NotificationMirrorConfig`:

- `preferencesName`: SharedPreferences file for the owner policy and pause state.
- `historyKeyAlias`: Android Keystore alias, also the AES-GCM associated data.
- `historyFileName`: no-backup file holding the encrypted history.
- `listener`: the host's concrete `NotificationMirrorListenerService` subclass.

These names are migration-sensitive. A host adopting this module keeps the values it already
used so installed owners keep their policy and history meaning.

Extend `NotificationMirrorListenerService`, return the shared mirror from `mirror()`, and declare
the subclass in the host manifest (exported, `android:permission="android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE"`,
`android.service.notification.NotificationListenerService` intent filter). The host's own bridge
(Capacitor or otherwise) calls `status`, `apps`, `update`, `pause`, `list`, `action`, `history`,
`clearHistoryBoundary` and `redact` from foreground, owner-initiated UI only, and calls `redact()`
when its UI pauses.

## Semantics

- `update` requires the policy revision the owner reviewed and purges history and row identities
  before acknowledging a new policy. Selecting a changed app (signature mismatch) is refused until
  the owner removes and selects it again.
- Rows come only from another package for the same Android user, from that package's own uid,
  with a still-matching pinned signature. A locked device, disabled or paused policy, revoked
  access, screen off returns no rows. A full callback queue invalidates row identities.
- `action(open)` sends only a content intent created by the posting app's uid and never for a
  secret notification; `action(dismiss)` cancels only a clearable row.
- More than 100 active selected notifications is an explicit refusal; the library never returns a partial active list.
- History keeps label, time and state for still-selected apps, at most 100 events for 24 hours.

## Tests

`node --test test/native-host/policy.node.mjs` runs the framework-free policy tests on a JDK.
The repository Turbo task forwards the SDK and JDK locations and reruns this native
compile check without cache because the installed toolchains live outside the workspace.
`test/native-host/android-compile.node.mjs` compiles every Android source against the SDK
`android.jar`. This check requires `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` with an API 33+ platform; a missing SDK is an error.

`test/android-consumer` builds a host and two synthetic notification producers.
Build `:host:assembleDebug`, `:host:assembleDebugAndroidTest`,
`:fixture:assembleSelectedDebug` and `:fixture:assembleExcludedDebug` with Gradle 8.13,
Java 21 and Android SDK 36. Install them only on a disposable API 35 emulator;
grant `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` to both fixture packages. Run the host instrumentation
with `-e disposableMirrorFixture 1`. The test grants and revokes access for its own
listener, posts synthetic notifications, verifies redaction and encrypted history,
and dismisses one exact row. Uninstall all four APKs afterward. This does not
certify physical-device behavior or a product's foreground policy.
