# @elizaos/plugin-maps

Provider-neutral maps domain for elizaOS agents: place lookup, route planning,
saved places, safe sharing, and navigation handoffs.

## Ownership and boundaries

- `MapsService` owns normalized maps behavior and adapter registration.
- Provider packages implement `MapsProviderAdapter`; this package never embeds
  provider credentials or provider-specific response shapes.
- Saved places use one agent-private canonical document per owner. Mutations
  must use the adapter's durable document CAS contract and preserve immutable
  operation-key history; never replace this with process-local locking alone.
  Preserve the per-owner bounds of 64 current places, 256 immutable operations,
  and 512 KiB serialized state. Resolve retained-key replay/conflict before
  rejecting new mutations at capacity; do not compact away idempotency history.
  Do not add another file store, scheduler, or identity graph.
- Native coordinates may be supplied by `@elizaos/capacitor-location`, but this
  package does not request device permissions or read device location itself.
- The plugin-local `/maps` view renders normalized results as a deterministic,
  provider-neutral schematic. It never fetches external tiles or invents
  attribution, ratings, availability, route alternatives, or geometry.
- Commercial provider adapters, provider legal-attribution metadata, and
  device-specific share/navigation launches belong to their owning connectors.

## Public surface

- `PlaceRef`, `RoutePlan`, and `SavedPlace` are validated normalized types.
- `MapsProviderAdapter` is the connector seam for place and route reads.
- Coordinate canonicalization must retain exact requested coordinates and an
  explicit `coordinateBinding` to the original coordinate place ID. Adapter
  identity by itself is not proof that a route endpoint is equivalent.
- `MAPS` is the umbrella action. `promoteSubactionsToActions` registers
  `MAPS_PLACE`, `MAPS_ROUTE`, `MAPS_SAVE`, `MAPS_SHARE`, and `MAPS_NAVIGATE`.
- Direct `MAPS` execution is read-only. Saves must use the promoted `MAPS_SAVE`
  action so runtime receipt settlement cannot be bypassed. Preserve promotion
  markers when changing per-action metadata.
- Idempotency replays return the original immutable operation plus current
  resource state. If a later update superseded it, return an unsuccessful
  historical result without an effect receipt; never claim that the prior
  desired state is current.
- Missing action inputs return a canonical form interaction and set
  `awaitingUserInput`; they never fabricate coordinates or places.
- View reads use the authenticated `serverInteract` broker. The view must not
  call `savePlace()` directly; its save control hands a reviewable `MAPS_SAVE`
  request to chat so runtime receipt settlement remains authoritative.

## Commands

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-maps test
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-maps typecheck
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-maps lint:check
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-maps build
bun run --cwd packages/app audit:app
```

## Verification

The provider-contract test drives a real HTTP adapter against the repository's
protocol-faithful fake upstream. Keep success, empty, validation, pagination,
rate-limit metadata, malformed/schema-drift responses, auth failures, network
failures, SSRF/DNS rebinding, redirects, response bounds, provider identity,
provider 4xx/5xx, opaque connection IDs, redaction, and read-policy coverage
intact. Saved-place tests must cover PGlite CAS persistence, owner scoping,
durable key history, receipt identity, current and historical replay, actual
runtime settlement, and forced datastore contention between independent
service instances.
