# @elizaos/capacitor-agent

Capacitor plugin that exposes agent lifecycle control (start, stop, status, chat, raw
request) to a WebView-hosted Eliza app on iOS, Android, and web/desktop.

See [bridge definitions](src/definitions.ts) for the native API. Native targets require their SDKs, registered bridge, and OS permissions.

## Development

Install dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root. Run from that root:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-agent build  # build
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-agent test   # tests
```
