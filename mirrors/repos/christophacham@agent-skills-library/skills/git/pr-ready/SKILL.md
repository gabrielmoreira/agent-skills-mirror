# Skill: PR Ready

## What This Skill Does

Automates the final preparation steps before opening a PR: run checks, write PR description, update changelog, and verify documentation updates.

## When to Use

- When the user says "ready for PR", "open a PR", or "prepare for review"
- After completing an `implement-phase` cycle
- Before running `diff-review`

Do NOT use this for the actual code review — use `diff-review` for that.

## Execution Model

- **Always**: the primary agent runs this skill directly.
- **Rationale**: PR preparation requires terminal access (git, CI), file editing (changelog), and user interaction (confirm PR title).
- **Output**: a PR opened (or ready to open) on GitHub.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Branch State

```bash
# Ensure we're on a feature branch, not main
git branch --show-current

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status

# Check for unpushed commits
git log origin/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null
```

If there are uncommitted changes, ask the user whether to commit them first.

### Step 2: Run All Checks

Run the project's CI checks locally:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` or `Makefile` for the check commands
2. Run them in order (lint → typecheck → test → build)
3. If any fail, ask the user whether to run `fix-ci` first or continue

### Step 3: Analyze the Diff

Get the diff against the target branch:

```bash
git diff main..HEAD --stat
git diff main..HEAD --shortstat
```

Categorize the changes (source, tests, docs, config, deps).

### Step 4: Check Documentation Impact

Run `validate-docs` patterns (lightweight, git-based):

- If source files changed → check if corresponding docs exist and are recent
- If public API changed → flag for doc update
- If new module/feature added → flag missing docs

Report findings but don't block — include in PR description as "Documentation Impact" section.

### Step 5: Update Changelog

If a `CHANGELOG.md` exists:

1. Read the `[Unreleased]` section
2. Add entry for this PR under the appropriate category (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed)
3. Use the commit messages as source material

### Step 6: Generate PR Description

Build the PR description from:

- **Summary**: one paragraph from commit messages
- **Type of Change**: checkboxes (feature, fix, docs, etc.)
- **Changes**: bullet list of key changes
- **Documentation Impact**: from Step 4
- **Testing**: what tests were added/modified
- **Checklist**: CI status, docs updated, changelog updated

Use the project's PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) if it exists.

### Step 7: Suggest Labels

Based on the diff analysis, suggest GitHub labels:

- File paths → category labels (e.g., `skills/` → `skill`, `agents/` → `agent`)
- Commit prefixes → type labels (`feat:` → `feature`, `fix:` → `bug`)
- Size → size labels (S/M/L based on lines changed)

### Step 8: Open or Preview PR

Ask the user:

- Confirm PR title
- Confirm target branch (default: `main`)
- Preview or directly open?

```bash
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md --label "<labels>"
```

## Rules

1. **Never push to main**: this skill operates on feature branches only.
2. **Checks before PR**: always run local checks. Don't create a PR that will immediately fail CI.
3. **Use existing templates**: if the project has a PR template, use it. Don't override.
4. **Changelog is optional**: only update if the project has a CHANGELOG.md. Don't create one.
5. **Ask before opening**: always confirm with the user before creating the PR. They may want to review the description first.
6. **No built-in explore agent**: do NOT use the built-in `explore` subagent type.
