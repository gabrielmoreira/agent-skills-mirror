# Jotai State Ownership

Use Jotai for client-only state, not as a second cache for IPC data.

## Ownership

- React Query owns server/IPC-backed data such as apps, chats, versions,
  settings, env vars, providers, files, diagnostics, and reports.
- Router/search params own primary navigation identity. If an atom mirrors a
  route value, keep writes centralized in route-level synchronization code or a
  navigation helper.
- Jotai owns client-only UI/runtime state that must survive component unmounts:
  selected UI modes, queues, in-flight streaming state, optimistic chat state,
  preview runtime state, and transient UI state shared across distant
  components.
- React local state owns form fields, modal visibility, measurement, and state
  used by a single component subtree.

## Entity Scoping

When state belongs to an entity, key it by that entity id instead of using a
singleton selected-entity value.

Good examples:

```ts
chatMessagesByIdAtom: Map<number, Message[]>;
isStreamingByIdAtom: Map<number, boolean>;
previewRunStateByAppIdAtom: Map<number, PreviewRunState>;
```

Avoid unkeyed global booleans for entity-specific async work. A value like
`loading: boolean` is only safe when exactly one operation can own it. Prefer
an app/chat/job keyed map and derive the currently visible value from the
selected id.

## Derived Atoms

Expose derived atoms or domain hooks for "current selected" reads:

```ts
currentPreviewErrorAtom = atom((get) => {
  const appId = get(selectedAppIdAtom);
  return appId == null ? undefined : get(previewErrorByAppIdAtom).get(appId);
});
```

Components should usually read `currentPreviewErrorAtom` rather than repeat
`selectedAppIdAtom` plus raw map lookup logic.

## Updates

- Use write-only atoms or domain helper hooks for repeated mutations such as
  append, clear, set-for-id, or remove-for-id.
- Keep high-frequency state, such as logs, separate from slower state so a log
  append does not rerender consumers of unrelated preview metadata.
- Combine fields only when they form one domain concept and are updated
  together. Do not create one mega atom for unrelated state.
- Always clone `Map` and `Set` values before modifying them so Jotai sees a new
  reference.

## Cleanup

When deleting an entity, prune any keyed Jotai state for that entity. Chat
state already uses helper atoms such as `removeChatIdFromAllTrackingAtom`; app
scoped runtime state should follow the same pattern.
