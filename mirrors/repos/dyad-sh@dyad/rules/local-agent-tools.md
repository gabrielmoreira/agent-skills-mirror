# Local Agent Tool Definitions

Agent tool definitions live in `src/pro/main/ipc/handlers/local_agent/tools/`. Each tool has a `ToolDefinition` with optional flags.

## Read-only / plan-only mode

- **`modifiesState: true`** must be set on any tool that writes to disk or modifies external state (files, database, etc.). This flag controls whether the tool is available in read-only (ask) mode and plan-only mode — see `buildAgentToolSet` in `tool_definitions.ts`.
- Similarly, code in the `handleLocalAgentStream` handler that writes to the workspace (e.g., `ensureDyadGitignored`, injecting synthetic todo reminders) should be guarded with `if (!readOnly && !planModeOnly)` checks. Injecting instructions that reference state-changing tools into non-writable runs will confuse the model since those tools are filtered out.

## Async I/O

- Use `fs.promises` (not sync `fs` methods) in any code running on the Electron main process (e.g., `todo_persistence.ts`) to avoid blocking the event loop.

## User-visible tool output

- For Local Agent post-tool side effects that happen after the model/tool loop (for example shared Supabase function redeploys), use `ctx.onXmlComplete(...)` with escaped `<dyad-output>` content to surface warnings/errors inline. `warningMessages` creates toast warnings, and throwing turns the whole stream into a `ChatErrorBox`.
- **`ctx.onXmlComplete` only updates the message `content` column and the UI; it does NOT make output visible to future agent turns.** `parseAiMessagesJson` reads from `aiMessagesJson` whenever it's present and ignores `content` entirely. For post-loop output that the agent should see next turn (deploy results, step-limit notices), also push a trailing assistant message into `accumulatedAiMessages` BEFORE the `aiMessagesJson` write, e.g.: `accumulatedAiMessages.push({ role: "assistant", content: [{ type: "text", text: xml }] })`.

## MCP consent results

- `requireMcpToolConsent` resolves to a structured result, not a bare boolean. If `npm run ts` reports `Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'McpConsentResult'`, update mocks to return `{ approved: true/false }`.

## SQL consent and auto-approval

- When changing `execute_sql` consent metadata or safety checks, audit both Agent mode (`shouldAutoApproveAgentTool` / `executeSqlTool.getConsentMetadata`) and Build mode auto-apply (`chat_stream_handlers.ts` with `autoApproveChanges`). A SQL safety rule only on the Agent tool path can still be bypassed by Build mode global auto-approve.
- SQL destructive-action classifiers that gate auto-approval must be conservative: incomplete/unparseable SQL, opaque dynamic execution (`DO`/`CALL`), and executing wrappers such as `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` should require consent unless the wrapped statement can be proven safe.
- Treat prepared-statement execution as opaque for SQL auto-approval too: top-level `PREPARE` can hide the statement body and top-level `EXECUTE` runs a previously prepared statement, so both should require consent unless the classifier can prove the executed statement is safe.

## Stream retries

- When extending `handleLocalAgentStream` retry behavior, do not only match transport errors like `"terminated"`. Providers can emit structured stream errors such as `{ type: "error", error: { type: "server_error", ... } }`, and those transient 5xx / rate-limit failures need explicit retry classification too.

## Metadata-only stop tools

- If a metadata-only tool such as `set_chat_summary` is added to `stopWhen`, audit downstream pass gates that inspect the final step's `toolCalls`. A final metadata tool call should not suppress safety follow-up passes such as incomplete todo reminders.

## Prompt and request snapshots

- When changing local-agent prompt text or tool descriptions, update both prompt unit snapshots and E2E request snapshots; stale request snapshots can still contain old tool descriptions even after unit prompt snapshots pass.
- Search all `e2e-tests/snapshots/` baselines for old tool-description text after regenerating request snapshots. Some request baselines are extensionless files such as `local_agent_explore_code.spec.ts_disabled`, not just `.txt` snapshots.
- When a local-agent tool is gated by a setting or experiment, keep related user-message hints in sync with the same gate. Request snapshots for the default-disabled path should not advertise or include a tool that `buildAgentToolSet` filters out.
- In `testing/fake-llm-server`, keep Anthropic local-agent fixture routing in sync with the OpenAI chat-completions route for synthetic continuation messages (`incomplete todo(s)`, persisted unfinished todos, and stream retry prompts). If Anthropic routing misses those markers, multi-pass fixtures fall back to the canned `file1.txt` response mid-flow.

## Attachment manifest lifecycle

- When deleting old `.dyad/media` attachment files, also prune `attachments-manifest.json` entries under the `attachments-manifest:${appPath}` lock. Read-time filtering hides broken entries but still leaves stale logical names that force unnecessary suffixes like `notes-2.txt` on future uploads.
- When registering `.dyad/media` files that may already exist (for example repeated `@media:` mentions), reuse an existing manifest entry for the same `storedFileName` before allocating a new logical name. Otherwise repeated references create noisy `attachments:*` aliases like `image-2.png`, `image-3.png`.

## Tool spec mock contexts

- When adding a required field to `AgentContext` (in `tools/types.ts`), grep `src/pro/main/ipc/handlers/local_agent/tools/*.spec.ts` and update every mock context literal. The TS error appears as e.g. `Property 'nitroEnabled' is missing in type ... but required in type 'AgentContext'` and surfaces only via `npm run ts` — `npm run lint` does not catch it.
