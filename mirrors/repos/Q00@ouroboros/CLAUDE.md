## ooo Commands (Dev Mode)

When the user types any of these commands, read the corresponding SKILL.md file and follow its instructions exactly:

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `ooo` (bare, no subcommand) | Read `skills/welcome/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo auto ...` | Read `skills/auto/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo interview ...` | Read `skills/interview/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo seed` | Read `skills/seed/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo run` | Read `skills/run/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo evaluate` or `ooo eval` | Read `skills/evaluate/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo evolve ...` | Read `skills/evolve/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo unstuck` or `ooo stuck` or `ooo lateral` | Read `skills/unstuck/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo status` or `ooo drift` | Read `skills/status/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo ralph` | Read `skills/ralph/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo tutorial` | Read `skills/tutorial/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo setup` | Read `skills/setup/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo welcome` | Read `skills/welcome/SKILL.md` and follow it |

| `ooo config` | Read `skills/config/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo qa` or `ooo qa ...` | Read `skills/qa/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo help` | Read `skills/help/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo update` | Read `skills/update/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo pm` or `ooo pm ...` | Read `skills/pm/SKILL.md` and follow it |

| `ooo publish` or `ooo publish ...` | Read `skills/publish/SKILL.md` and follow it |
| `ooo resume-session` | Read `skills/resume-session/SKILL.md` and follow it |

**Important**: Do NOT use the Skill tool. Read the file with the Read tool and execute its instructions directly.

## Agents

Bundled agents live in `src/ouroboros/agents/`. When a skill references an agent (e.g., `ouroboros:socratic-interviewer`), read its definition from `src/ouroboros/agents/{name}.md` and adopt that role. Use `OUROBOROS_AGENTS_DIR` or `.claude-plugin/agents/` only for explicit custom overrides.

## Pull Request Boundary Policy

Before implementing or reviewing a PR, read [Review Boundary Contract](CONTRIBUTING.md#review-boundary-contract). The PR description is the review contract, not an informal suggestion.

Require contributors to declare: the one user problem; supported inputs and execution conditions; observable contract and invariants; changed subsystem, data/security boundary, and owner; non-goals; and evidence. Do not absorb new lifecycle, rollback, concurrency, filesystem-authority, or other ownership requirements without a maintainer decision.

For every review finding, ask:

1. Does it reproduce under the promised inputs and execution conditions?
2. Does it break the promised contract?
3. Does fixing it require a new subsystem or ownership boundary?
4. Can the original user problem be solved without the subsystem introduced by this PR?
5. If scope is split, does immediate user-data or security risk remain?

Use these decisions:

- Q1 + Q2: **Changes Requested**.
- Q3 + Q5: stop and revisit the RFC with the maintainer; do not silently absorb the new subsystem or owner.
- Q3 + Q4 and not Q5: owned follow-up, not a blocker; require a named owner and link.
- Q5 without Q3 + Q5 escalation: **Changes Requested** for the immediate user-data or security risk.
- Outside the declared boundary without a contract violation: not a blocker; record a valid, actionable finding only as an owned follow-up with a named owner and tracking link; do not expand the PR.

Only the maintainer decides scope expansion. Keep review comments tied to the declared boundary and directly evidenced behavior. The declared boundary cannot waive existing public or repository contracts, approved issue or RFC requirements, or maintainer decisions.

## Shipping a change (read before you commit)

**The code you edit is not the code that runs, by default.** The checked-in
`.mcp.json` points at the published PyPI package, so edits to this working tree
have no effect on a client until you repoint it at local source. See
[docs/contributing/developing.md](docs/contributing/developing.md).

`main` is protected: direct pushes are rejected with `GH006`, for everyone,
including the owner. Every change lands through a squash-merged PR, so a
release tag must be created on the merged `main` commit — not before.

Four checks are required to merge — reproduce them locally first:

```bash
uv run ruff format src/ tests/ && uv run ruff check src/ tests/ --fix
uv run mypy src/ouroboros
uv run pytest
```

(`Ruff Lint`, `MyPy Type Check`, `Test Python 3.12`, `Bridge TypeScript`.)

Other gates fire conditionally and are easy to trip blind:

- **Issue link present** — every PR needs `Refs #123` in the body. Exempt via
  the `no-issue` label, or a title starting `chore(deps)` / `chore(release)` /
  `release:`. Note `chore: release vX.Y.Z` does *not* match the prefix.
- **enforce-module-size** — 2000-line cap per module; grandfathered modules may
  shrink, never grow, and no new entries.
- **enforce-boundary** — no domain keywords (`github`, `jira`, `slack`, …) in
  `src/ouroboros/auto/`.
- **enforce-perf-budget** — PRs touching `src/ouroboros/auto/` need the R-run
  table filled in the PR body.

**[docs/contributing/ci-gates.md](docs/contributing/ci-gates.md)**.

# Ouroboros — Specification-First AI Development

> Before telling AI what to build, define what should be built.
> As Socrates asked 2,500 years ago — "What do you truly know?"
> Ouroboros turns that question into an evolutionary AI workflow engine.

Most AI coding fails at the input, not the output. Ouroboros fixes this by
**exposing hidden assumptions before any code is written**.

1. **Socratic Clarity** — Question until ambiguity ≤ 0.2
2. **Ontological Precision** — Solve the root problem, not symptoms
3. **Evolutionary Loops** — Each evaluation cycle feeds back into better specs

```
Interview → Seed → Execute → Evaluate
    ↑                           ↓
    └─── Evolutionary Loop ─────┘
```
