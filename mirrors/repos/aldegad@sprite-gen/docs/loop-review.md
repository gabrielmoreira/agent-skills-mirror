# Loop automation and visual review

Use the normal pipeline first. No model needs to choose every cut:

```bash
sprite-gen video-loop --frames-dir keyed/ --out-dir loop/ --state run --fps 24
```

The caller must pass the **measured source fps**, not always 24. `video-set` obtains it
from `video-frames`. The default anchor is `none` in both commands. The default clip
request remains 3 seconds; it does not determine the playback speed.

## What the script decides

- It measures repeat candidates from the keyed frames and the state's time window.
- It scores the last displayed frame -> first frame against ordinary adjacent motion,
  reducing repeated-pose stalls at a loop boundary.
- Gaits below the duration floor may use a double period, as before. Above that floor,
  similarly credible non-exact candidates at P and approximately 2P now retain 2P once
  when it fits the window and passes the periodicity gate. Keeping two real repetitions
  is preferable to discarding a potentially distinct phase. This may produce a two-cycle
  loop of a genuine short gait; frames keep their original timing.
- Near-exact short repeats, implausible longer repeats, and non-gait states are not
  extended by that ambiguity policy. There is no character-specific frame count.
- Alpha, frame counts and seam metrics are checked before the output is accepted.

A numeric pass establishes those facts. It does **not** establish correct foot contact,
anatomical left/right alternation, a believable gait, or that the source was drawn well.
`cycle.review_recommended = true` marks an ambiguous-harmonic choice; `false` means
that this particular heuristic did not flag ambiguity, not that visual quality is certified.
The direct CLI summary preserves that flag and the guard evidence. `video-set` also
propagates them in its item report and marks the table row `OK (review gait)`.

## Material for a vision-capable reviewer

Provide the original clip, the generated loop played at source speed for at least three
repeats, the JSON report, and an ordered contact sheet with original frame indices. For
an ambiguous harmonic include both P and 2P candidates using the same size and fps.
A single still cannot establish a gait cycle. If the model cannot consume video, provide
ordered frames spanning at least two candidate cycles, including several frames on both
sides of the wrap. Do not ask it to judge motion from an unordered image collage.

A human or a vision-capable model should check:

1. Do the limbs alternate, or does one phase restart before its counterpart appears?
2. At the wrap, does motion stall, snap, or reverse compared with nearby frames?
3. Does the torso translate across the canvas, or are only the limbs/clothing moving?
4. Are deformation or contact errors already present in the source clip?

Return the evidence frame indices, chosen mode/start/length, anchor, reason and any
uncertainty. Keep that decision separate from the unmodified automatic report. A model
without the required visual input must not claim it reviewed the gait. Ambiguous or
contradictory visual evidence should remain unresolved rather than inventing a precise cut.

## Explicit adjustments

If the visible full cycle is clear but the automatic candidate is wrong, make the choice
explicit and keep the report's `kind = fixed`:

```bash
sprite-gen video-loop --frames-dir keyed/ --out-dir reviewed/ --state run \
  --fps 24 --cycle fixed --start <zero-based-index> --length <frame-count>
```

Do not double a frame count unconditionally or duplicate existing frames. Choose a
continuous interval in the original sequence. `--min-len/--max-len` can instead narrow
an evidenced search interval while leaving the exact cut to the detector.

Use `--anchor feet` only when the source shows slow in-canvas translation. It removes a
linear horizontal trend; it is not a universal stabilizer, does not pin each planted foot,
and can alter an already stationary subject. Start with the default `none`. Compare with
`feet` on identical frames before selecting it. Normal body bounce, clothing motion and
a model's changing anatomy are not position drift.

Do not raise `--seam-max` merely to make a failed result pass. A source lacking a complete
usable cycle may require a longer/new clip. Regeneration is a new generation request,
not a hidden fallback inside loop extraction.

## Reproducibility

Store the source identity, engine version, exact CLI arguments, selected report and
whether a person/model overrode the automatic choice. Keep the same fps for comparisons.
Render comparison videos from PNG strips or lossless frame outputs, not palette GIFs.
A reviewed example is not evidence that all future inputs will automatically attain its
quality. Consumers can route `review_recommended` to review while retaining the automatic
result as an explicitly labelled candidate.
