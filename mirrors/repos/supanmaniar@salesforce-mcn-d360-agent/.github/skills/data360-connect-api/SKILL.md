description: 'Call Salesforce Data 360 Connect APIs (data streams, segments, activations, identity resolutions, connections, data spaces, data kits, calculated insights, machine learning, clean rooms, data governance) from the Salesforce CLI without an MCP server. Use when managing Data 360 data streams, building or activating segments, configuring identity resolution, or working with any /ssot endpoint.'

# Data 360 Connect API

Replaces the MCP server's `mcnext_*` catalog tools for the `data360-connect`
family — the largest family, with **383 endpoints across 35 resource groups**.

## When to Use

- Managing data streams, connections, and connectors
- Creating, updating, or activating segments
- Configuring identity resolution rulesets and match rules
- Working with data spaces, data kits, and data governance
- Calculated insights, machine learning, notebook AI, clean rooms
- Any endpoint whose path begins `/ssot/`

## Routing

`data360-connect` endpoints are served from the **org instance** under
`/services/data/vXX/ssot/...`:

```
{instanceUrl}/services/data/v66.0/ssot/segments
```

Use [sf-api.sh](../../../scripts/sf-api.sh) in its default (instance) mode. Do
**not** pass `--tenant` — that is only for the `data360` family.

## Procedure

1. **Discover the endpoint.** With 383 endpoints, always filter:

   ```bash
   node scripts/catalog-search.mjs list --family data360-connect --group Segments
   node scripts/catalog-search.mjs list --family data360-connect --search "activation"
   node scripts/catalog-search.mjs list --family data360-connect --kind create
   ```

2. **Inspect parameters and body shape:**

   ```bash
   node scripts/catalog-search.mjs describe segments.create-segment
   ```

3. **Call it:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/sf-api.sh --path /ssot/segments --query 'batchSize=20'
   ```

4. **For writes**, pass a JSON body matching the described schema:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/sf-api.sh --method POST --path /ssot/segments \
     --body @payload.json
   ```

## Resource Groups

The 35 groups, by endpoint count:

| Group | Endpoints | Group | Endpoints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Governance | 59 | Data Streams | 12 |
| Machine Learning | 37 | Data Model Objects | 11 |
| Notebook AI | 35 | Data Actions | 10 |
| Connections | 23 | Data Action Targets | 9 |
| Activations | 20 | Data Transforms | 9 |
| Segments | 19 | Data Kits | 8 |
| Identity Resolutions | 17 | Data Shares | 8 |
| Calculated Insights | 16 | Data Spaces | 8 |
| Connectors | 15 | Document AI | 7 |
| Data Lake Objects | 14 | Insights | 6 |
| Metadata | 13 | Search Index | 5 |
| Activation Targets | 12 | Others | — |

Run `node scripts/catalog-search.mjs groups` for the authoritative list.

## Common Operations

| Operation | Method | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List segments | GET | `/ssot/segments` |
| Create segment | POST | `/ssot/segments` |
| Get segment | GET | `/ssot/segments/:segmentApiNameOrId` |
| Update segment | PATCH | `/ssot/segments/:segmentApiName` |
| Delete segment | DELETE | `/ssot/segments/:segmentApiName` |
| List data streams | GET | `/ssot/data-streams` |
| List data spaces | GET | `/ssot/data-spaces` |
| List identity resolutions | GET | `/ssot/identity-resolutions` |
| List activations | GET | `/ssot/activations` |
| List connections | GET | `/ssot/connections` |

## Gotchas

- **Segment SQL is validated on write.** `POST`/`PATCH /ssot/segments` reject
  invalid SQL with a descriptive error — read it before retrying.
- **Deletes are destructive.** `DELETE /ssot/segments/:segmentApiName` removes
  the segment permanently. Confirm with the user first.
- **Pagination uses `batchSize` and `offset`**, and responses include a
  `currentPageUrl` you can follow directly.
- **`orderByExpression` uses bracket syntax**, e.g. `[Name asc]`.
- **Some operations are asynchronous** (segment publish, data transforms,
  ML predictions). See [async-jobs-and-cache](../async-jobs-and-cache/SKILL.md).
