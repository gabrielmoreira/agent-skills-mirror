# Operational Protocols (Common Definition)

Standard operational protocols shared by all agents. Each agent's Operational section need only specify **journal-specific topics** (1-2 lines) and reference this file for everything else.

---

## Journal

Each agent maintains a personal journal at `.agents/{agent-name}.md`.

**Format:**
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]
**[Topic-specific field]:** [Content]
**Insight:** [What was learned]
**Apply when:** [Future scenario where this applies]
```

**Rules:**
- Create the file if missing on first use
- Record only genuinely reusable insights — not task logs
- Each agent defines its own topic focus (e.g., Scout: investigation patterns, Bolt: bottleneck learnings)
- Also read `.agents/PROJECT.md` for cross-agent context before starting work

---

## Activity Log

All agents log activity to `.agents/PROJECT.md` (shared cross-agent log).

**Format:**
```
| YYYY-MM-DD | AgentName | Action | Scope (files/area) | Outcome |
```

**Rules:**
- Add one row per task completion
- Before starting work: check PROJECT.md exists and read recent entries for context
- When orchestrating: ensure downstream agents also log their activity

---

## AUTORUN Protocol

When executing in AUTORUN mode, emit step completion markers.

**Format:**
```
_STEP_COMPLETE:
  Agent: [AgentName]
  Status: SUCCESS | PARTIAL | BLOCKED | FAILED
  Output: [Brief summary of results]
  Next: [NextAgent] | VERIFY | DONE
```

**Rules:**
- Emit after completing your assigned work
- PARTIAL: some deliverables produced but not all
- BLOCKED: cannot proceed without external input
- FAILED: attempted but could not produce deliverables
- Full protocol details → `_common/AUTORUN.md`

---

## Nexus Hub Protocol

All agents operate in hub-and-spoke mode through Nexus.

**Input marker:** `## NEXUS_ROUTING` — Nexus is routing a task to you
**Output marker:** `## NEXUS_HANDOFF` — Return results to Nexus

**Handoff format:** → `_common/HANDOFF.md`

**Rules:**
- Never hand off directly to another agent — always return to Nexus
- Include all fields required by the handoff format
- Attach relevant artifacts and findings

---

## Output Language

- Explanations, reports, questions: **Japanese**
- Code, identifiers, APIs, commit messages: **Repository conventions** (typically English)

---

## Git

Follow `_common/GIT_GUIDELINES.md`:
- Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`
- No agent names in commits or PRs
- Subject < 50 characters, imperative mood
- Body explains "why", not "what"

---

## Subagent Parallel

When a task has 2-3 independent subtasks, agents may spawn sub-agents via the Agent tool for parallel execution.

**Decision & patterns:** → `_common/SUBAGENT.md`

---

## Self-Evolution

All agents load prior context before starting work (Tier 1). Agents with learning loops run post-task calibration (Tier 2).

**Protocol:** → `_common/SELF_EVOLUTION.md`
**Outward signals:** → `_common/EVOLUTION.md`
